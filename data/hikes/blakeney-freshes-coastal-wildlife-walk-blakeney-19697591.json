    "summary": "A 17.1 km hard coastal route around Blakeney Freshes, blending salt marshes, reedbeds, and coastal paths with potential marsh crossings and boardwalk sections. Expect wildlife viewing opportunities, exposed weather, and variable terrain; plan for a full day and check tide times before starting.",
    "terrain_summary": "The terrain combines coastal footpaths, gravel tracks, salt marsh edges, mud flats, tidal creeks, and intermittent boardwalks. Expect soft, uneven ground, seasonal mud, and stretches that are exposed to wind and spray. Some sections may be waterlogged after rain; good grip and waterproof footwear are essential.",
    "safety_notes": "Pay attention to tides: parts of the route sit within the Blakeney Freshes and can become inaccessible or dangerous at high tide. Check local tide tables and plan to only cross marsh areas at safe times. Wear sturdy waterproof boots with good grip and be prepared for mud and slippery boards. Stay on marked paths to protect delicate habitats and avoid disturbing wildlife. Carry a map, compass or GPS, a fully charged phone, and a tide timetable. Let someone know your route and expected return. Bring sufficient water and snacks, weather-appropriate clothing, sun protection, and a small first aid kit. Check local dog policy for Blakeney Freshes, as dogs may be restricted in sensitive wildlife areas. In windy conditions, brace against gusts and seek shelter if storms approach.",
