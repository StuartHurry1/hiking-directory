    "summary": "A challenging 19 km coastal traverse on the John O'Groats Trail from Dunbeath to Lybster. The route blends rugged coastline, open moorland, and intermittent farm trails. It is exposed, remote, and physically demanding, suited to experienced hikers with solid navigation skills.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rocky shoreline, grassy paths, peat bogs, and occasional farm lanes. Surfaces can be uneven, wet, and muddy, with exposed ridges and potential slips on slick rocks. Sea spray and strong winds are common; some sections may be eroded or require careful footing.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a remote, exposed coastal route with limited services. Check weather and tide conditions; bring navigation tools (map and compass) even if using a GPS. Inform someone of your plan, carry extra clothing, food, and water, and be prepared for rapid changes in conditions. Slippery surfaces, boggy patches, and uneven ground require careful footing. Mobile reception may be unreliable in remote parts.",
