    "summary": "Beinn Dearg Trail is a demanding long-distance mountain hike in the UK, stretching about 23.8 km. Expect rugged terrain, sustained ascent, and exposed sections. Good fitness, navigation skills, and weather preparedness are essential for a safe day on the trail.",
    "terrain_summary": "Rugged alpine-style terrain with rocky paths, peat bogs, and exposed ridges. Expect uneven footing, occasional scrambling, and steep ascents. Weather can bring wind, rain, and glare, so solid footwear and reliable waterproofing are crucial.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard, remote hike where weather can change rapidly. Before you go: check the forecast and daylight hours, carry a map and compass (GPS as a backup), and tell someone your planned route and return time. Carry enough food and water, stay hydrated, and turn back if conditions deteriorate. Watch for fatigue, hypothermia, and dehydration. Mobile coverage is often limited; consider a satellite messenger or PLB. Use caution on exposed sections and loose rock; boggy ground and long descents can be strenuous.",
