    "summary": "A demanding 17.1 km hike along the Former Chiltern Way in the UK. Expect a mix of rolling chalk hills, woodland sections, and rural lanes with gates and occasional steep climbs, making for a strenuous day on varied terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Diverse surfaces create a varied trek: firm country lanes, grassy hill paths, chalk tracks, and woodland trails. Moderate to uneven ground with some muddy patches, stiles, gates, and exposed sections where views over the countryside are best.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for 4–6 hours and check weather and daylight hours before starting. Wear sturdy boots with good grip and bring a map and compass (or GPS) even if the route is well marked. Stay on public paths, mind gates and livestock, and be prepared for mud after rain. Carry enough water and snacks, and let someone know your route and expected finish time. Have a charged phone and a basic first aid kit; take extra layers for cold or windy conditions.",
