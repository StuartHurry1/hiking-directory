    "summary": "A challenging 32.4 km circular hike around Canterbury's historic middle ring, combining rural lanes, footpaths, and occasional street sections. The route is demanding with long distances, variable terrain, and potential mud.",

    "safety_notes": "This is a long and strenuous hike. Plan for a full day and check the weather forecast. Wear sturdy boots and bring waterproof clothing. Carry enough water and snacks, plus a map or GPS. Be mindful of road crossings, livestock, and gates. Let someone know your plan and expected finish time. In winter daylight is limited and mud can be extensive; during summer hydrate and protect from sun.",
