    "summary": "GM Ringway Stage 14 is a hard 43 km stage of the GM Ringway network in the United Kingdom. The route combines long distances with varied terrain and elevation, demanding good stamina, navigation, and careful planning for a full-day hike.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of roadside paths, woodland trails, and open moorland. Terrain can be uneven, with muddy or rocky sections, boggy ground after rain, and gradual to steep ascents. Some stretches may have limited waymarking or exposed weather, so map reading and navigation are important.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, hard stage. Plan for a full day. Start early and check weather forecasts; carry a map and compass (and know how to use them) or a reliable GPS; inform someone of your planned route and return time; be prepared for UK moorland weather, including wind and rain; ensure adequate food and water; wear sturdy boots and dress in layers; stay on marked paths where possible; be mindful of fatigue and have an exit plan; phone signal can be limited in remote sections; carry a whistle and an emergency shelter or space blanket; know your limits and turn back if conditions deteriorate.",
