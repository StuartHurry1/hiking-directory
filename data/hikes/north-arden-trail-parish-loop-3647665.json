    "summary": "The North Arden Trail - Parish Loop is a 6.8 km circular hike in the UK offering a moderate challenge and a varied mix of countryside scenery. The route typically includes quiet country lanes, pasture tracks, and woodland sections, with gentle elevation changes and opportunities to observe local parish landmarks.

    "terrain_summary": "The trail combines well-trodden paths, grassy verges, and occasional muddy sections after rain.

    "safety_notes": "Weather in the UK can change rapidly; check a reliable forecast before you go. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and bring a waterproof layer. Carry a map or offline navigation, and stay on marked paths. Be mindful of livestock and close gates after you pass.

If hiking alone, share your plan with someone and consider daylight constraints, especially in winter.",
