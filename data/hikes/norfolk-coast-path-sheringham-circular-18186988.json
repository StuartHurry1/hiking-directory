    "summary": "A challenging 23.9 km circular hike along the Norfolk Coast Path, starting and ending in Sheringham. This coastal route blends cliff-top trails, dune systems, shingle beaches, and expansive sea views, demanding solid footing and good stamina to complete the circuit.",
    "terrain_summary": "Varied terrain includes firm cliff-top paths with panoramic views, soft dune tracks, gravel and sand coastal sections, and stretches over shingle beaches. Some segments can be uneven, muddy after rain, or windy and exposed. Tidal influence may affect beach stretches and boardwalks; expect sections where footing can be loose and footing uncertain.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times and weather before starting; coastal conditions can change rapidly and some parts are exposed. Stay on marked paths, beware of cliff edges and soft ground after rain. Carry a map and compass or GPS, plus a fully charged phone, and inform someone of your route and timings. Bring plenty of water and high-energy snacks; wear sturdy waterproof footwear and dress in layers. In remote stretches mobile coverage may be limited—plan accordingly and have a contingency plan for emergencies.",
