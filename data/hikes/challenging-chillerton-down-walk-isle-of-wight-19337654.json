    "summary": "A challenging 30.5 km ridge walk on the Isle of Wight known as the Challenging Chillerton Down Walk. This hard-length route traverses exposed upland ridges with panoramic views over the island, featuring grassy downs, rocky tracks, and occasional woodland edges. The hike demands good stamina, navigation skills, and a willingness to contend with exposed, windy sections; expect several hours of ascent and descent across varied terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Exposed chalk downs and grassy ridge paths with intermittent stone tracks. Open, windy sections give panoramic views, while surfaces range from compact turf to loose stones. Occasional woodland edges provide brief shelter but overall footing can be uneven and technical in places.",
    "safety_notes": "- Weather in the UK can change rapidly; check forecasts before you go and be prepared for sudden wind and rain. - Navigation: carry a detailed map and compass (and know how to use them); mobile signal may be unreliable in exposed upland areas. - Exposure: long, open sections increase sun, wind, and cold exposure; dress in layers and bring a windproof shell. - Distance and time: 30.5 km with significant elevation; plan for 6–9+ hours depending on pace and conditions. - Gates and livestock: close all gates behind you and watch for livestock on the route. - Water and food: carry enough water and high-energy food; know where to refill if possible. - Personal safety: inform someone of your route and ETA; if in doubt, turn back.",
