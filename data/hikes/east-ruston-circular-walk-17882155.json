    "summary": "A challenging 24.2 km circular hike starting and finishing near East Ruston in the UK. The route traverses open farmland, hedged footpaths, woodland tracks, and occasional road sections. Expect long distances, uneven terrain and potentially muddy conditions, with rural scenery and a quiet, remote feel.",
    "terrain_summary": "Varied rural terrain: grassy and stony paths, hedged field edges, woodland tracks, and short tarmacked sections. Can be muddy after rain; some climbs and uneven footing require good ankle support. Navigation is straightforward but follow route markers and maps when visibility is poor.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day (6+ hours). Check weather and daylight hours; UK weather can change quickly. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers; bring a waterproof jacket. Carry a map and compass or GPS, plus a charged phone. Bring sufficient water and high-energy snacks; have a small first aid kit. Let someone know your plan; be prepared for limited mobile signal in remote sections; watch for muddy or boggy stretches and livestock gates; stay on the public right of way.",
