    "summary": "The Knettishall Heath Circular Walk is an 11.3 km moderate hike that circles through the heathland and woodland around Knettishall Heath near Thetford Forest in the UK. The route starts and finishes at a local car park and offers open heathland, fern glades, and quiet woodland trails with occasional viewpoints over the surrounding countryside.",
    "terrain_summary": "The path combines wide forest tracks with exposed heathland paths. Expect a mix of firm woodland surfaces, soft grassy sections, and some muddy, uneven ground, especially after rain. The route includes gentle ascents and a few rocky or rooty sections; wear sturdy footwear and watch for loose stones and slippery roots.",
    "safety_notes": "Trail markers are generally reliable, but conditions can change with weather. After rain the heathland could be muddy and slippery; be prepared for uneven ground and exposed roots. Ticks are common in heathland and woodland; check for ticks after the walk. Carry water, weather-appropriate clothing, a map or GPS, and a basic first aid kit. Let someone know your plans and consider shorter options if visibility or daylight is limited.",
