    "terrain_summary": "Flat to gently rolling terrain with marshy bogs, mud patches, and intermittent boardwalks. Ground can be soft and wet; waterproof boots and quick-dry clothing are recommended. Some sections may be uneven or slippery after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in the UK can change rapidly; dress in layers and bring a waterproof outer layer. Stay on marked paths as boggy areas can be unstable. Wear waterproof boots and bring extra socks. Carry a map or offline navigation, a charged phone, and a small amount of food and water. If hiking with children or pets, supervise closely and avoid unmarked or deep bog areas. Plan for daylight and adjust the walk if visibility or conditions deteriorate.",
