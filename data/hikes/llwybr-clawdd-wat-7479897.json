    "summary": "Llwybr Clawdd Wat is a long-distance UK hike tracing the historic Wat's Dyke earthwork. Spanning about 160.7 km, this hard route traverses rural farmland, hedged lanes, and occasional woodlands, with varied terrain and multiple days of trekking between settlements.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain varies along the route: rural tracks and field boundaries, grassy paths, some stiles and gates, minor road crossings, wet and muddy sections after rain, and sections following the historic dyke line. Elevation changes range from flat sections to gentle undulations and occasional hills; expect exposed stretches in open countryside.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a multi-day hike with long stretches between settlements. Plan carefully for weather and daylight: UK conditions can change rapidly. Carry a reliable map and compass (GPS as a backup), and know how to navigate. Pack waterproofs, warm layers, and sufficient food and water; stay hydrated and fueled. Inform someone of your itinerary, check access rights for camping, and carry a small first aid kit and emergency items.
