    "summary": "Abbey Line Trail is a challenging 36.4 km long-distance hike in the UK, following a historic rail corridor and featuring mixed terrain from rural fields to urban stretches. Designed for experienced hikers, the route demands good stamina, navigation, and careful planning due to variable conditions and limited services along the way.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail traverses a mix of surfaces: timber/grassland tracks, compacted railbed sections, gravel paths, canal towpaths, farm tracks, woodland paths, and occasional road crossings. Expect uneven surfaces, loose stones, wet ground after rain, and some exposed or ridgeline sections. Elevation is variable but can include steep climbs and long gentle gradients; plan for long, steady days.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan each stage with daylight and weather in mind. Carry a detailed map and compass (and a GPS as backup), informing someone of your planned route and times. UK weather can change quickly; bring waterproofs and warm layers, plus a headtorch and spare batteries. Be prepared for remote stretches with limited mobile signal and transport options; have a plan for contingencies or shorter sections. Respect rights of way and farm access closures; carry emergency contact info.",
