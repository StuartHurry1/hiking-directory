    "summary": "The John O'Groats Trail segment from Culbokie to Alness is a demanding 28.2 km hike through Scotland’s far north. It combines exposed coast, peat moorland, forest tracks, and occasional road sections, delivering remote scenery and a real test for experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied mix: coastal paths with sea spray and wind, wide peat bogs and tussocky ground, rocky steps and uneven trails, forest tracks, and short road stints. Elevation is rolling with long climbs in places; navigation can be tricky in mist; footing can be wet and muddy, especially after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a full-day hike and check the weather in advance; conditions on the north coast can change rapidly. The route includes remote sections with limited services, so carry a map and compass, know the route, and tell someone your plans. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and use layered clothing to cope with wind and cold. Bring enough water and high-energy snacks; have a backup plan for getting back if the weather worsens. In winter, ice and deep mud increase risk; avoid if forecasts are poor. Stay aware of traffic on road sections and consider going with a companion.",
