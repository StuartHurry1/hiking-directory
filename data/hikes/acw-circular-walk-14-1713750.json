    "summary": "The ACW Circular Walk 14 is a demanding 44.2 km long-distance loop in the United Kingdom, designed for experienced hikers. The route traverses varied countryside, farmland, and rural lanes with mixed terrain and notable elevation changes. It rewards stamina, solid navigation, and thorough planning, typically taking a full day or more to complete depending on pace and conditions.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of grassy and compact paths, dirt tracks, farm lanes, hedgerows, stiles, gates, and some road sections. Surfaces can be uneven and muddy after rain, with exposed upland stretches. Navigation may be required in uncertain sections, so carry a map and compass even if signs are present.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for the length and potential weather changes. Tell someone your route and expected finish time. Carry sufficient water and food, spare warm layers, and waterproof gear. Wear sturdy boots with good grip. Bring a map and compass (GPS as backup). Check daylight hours and start early in shorter days. In rural areas, mobile signal can be unreliable; know emergency numbers and have a plan to seek help if needed. Be mindful of livestock and farm traffic on shared paths, and respect countryside codes.",
