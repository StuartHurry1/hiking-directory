    "summary": "Irvine Valley Trail is a long-distance, hard-rated hike in the UK, spanning approximately 52.2 km. The route tests endurance with sustained climbs, varied terrain, and potential weather exposure. It suits experienced hikers with solid navigation and thorough planning, often best done as either a multi-day trek or a lengthy day hike with support.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses a mix of country lanes, forest tracks, moorland stretches, and rocky sections. Expect muddy paths after rain, uneven footing, exposed ridges, and possible stream crossings. Significant elevation gain and frequent changes in terrain demand careful footing and good stamina.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for rapidly changing UK weather, short daylight hours in winter, and potential navigation challenges. Carry a detailed map and compass, a charged phone with offline maps, and a means to contact/route friends. Start early, tell someone your plan, and pace yourself to avoid fatigue. Pack sufficient water and food, waterproof clothing, and a basic first-aid kit; trekking poles can help on rough or steep sections.",
