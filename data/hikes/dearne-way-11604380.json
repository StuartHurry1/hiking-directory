    "summary": "Dearne Way is a challenging 77 km long-distance hike in the UK, best tackled as a multi-day trek. The route requires good fitness, navigation, and the ability to endure varying weather and terrain. Expect rural farmland, hedgerows, and occasional moorland sections, with significant elevation changes and potential mud underfoot.",
    "terrain_summary": "The hike combines mixed rural tracks, grassy paths, gravel lanes, and occasional moorland stretches. Expect uneven surfaces, cattle byres, soft peat, and possible boggy sections after rain. Some road crossings and longer stretches of exposure mean you should be prepared for changing conditions and navigation challenges.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan multi-day logistics with daylight hours in mind. Carry a map and compass (or GPS), and know how to navigate in open countryside. Tell someone your itinerary. Weather in the UK can be highly variable; bring waterproof gear and warm layers. Stay hydrated, pack extra food, and have emergency shelter and a means of communication. Be mindful of livestock, fells, and wet boggy ground that can be slippery.",
