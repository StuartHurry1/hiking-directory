    "summary": "A demanding 18.3 km circular hike around the Manifold Valley in the UK. The route combines rugged moorland and valley paths, with sections of rocky track and occasional stream crossings. Expect elevation gain, long daylight hours in season, and a challenging day for experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "Rugged mix of rocky trails, grassy paths, and exposed limestone sections. River/stream crossings after rain, muddy patches, steep climbs in places, and stony descents. Navigation is straightforward in open sections but can be tricky in poor visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan a long day (6–8+ hours). Wear sturdy, waterproof boots and dress for changing UK weather. Carry a map and compass (GPS as backup) and know how to use them. Bring sufficient water and high-energy snacks. Check weather and daylight hours; the valley can be exposed and conditions change quickly. Inform someone of your route and ETA. Take care on slippery rocky sections and after rain; river crossings may be challenging after heavy rain. Respect livestock gates, and have a plan to turn back if the weather deteriorates.",
