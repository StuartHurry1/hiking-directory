    "summary": "The Grand Union Canal Walk is a challenging long-distance hike along the UK's historic Grand Union Canal, covering about 219 km. The route runs along long, flat towpaths with occasional locks, bridges, and urban sections. Expect sustained distance, variable surfaces, and a mix of rural scenery and canal-side towns. It requires solid planning, a steady pace, and readiness for weather changes and navigational decisions.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily flat canal towpath terrain with intermittent sections on rural banks and urban canal-side paths. Surface is mostly compact dirt and gravel with some paved stretches; occasional uneven areas near locks and undergrowth. Expect wet conditions after rain and seasonal debris or mud in certain stretches.",
    "safety_notes": "Walk segments can be busy on towpaths, so stay alert for cyclists and other pedestrians. Navigate locks, narrow bridges, and road crossings with care. UK weather can change quickly—bring waterproof layers, warm clothing, and sun protection. Maintain distance from the water's edge, supervise children, and plan for divisions between towns for supplies and bail-out points. Ensure adequate daylight for longer stretches and have a plan for emergencies along the route.",
