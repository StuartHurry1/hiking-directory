    "summary": "Bradenham Beech Woods Walk is a challenging 23.2 km circuit that explores Bradenham's ancient beech woods and surrounding countryside in the UK. This hard-rated hike combines forest trails, open field paths, and occasional road sections, with varying elevation and long miles between landmarks. Expect technical footing in places, muddy stretches after rain, and a demanding all-day trek suitable for experienced hikers with good fitness. The route offers woodland scenery, potential wildlife sightings, and a sense of remoteness despite proximity to villages.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route largely follows forest tracks through Bradenham Beech Woods, with leaf litter, exposed roots, and mixed traction. Muddy patches are common after rain, and footing can be uneven and slippery on damp days. Expect a combination of gentle to moderate climbs, long stretches on gravel tracks and pasture lanes, and occasional short road sections. Navigation is straightforward but some signage may be sparse in remote stretches, so a map or GPS is recommended.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, hard hike requiring good fitness and daylight planning. Weather in the UK can change quickly; bring layers and a waterproof jacket. Wear sturdy, ankle-supporting boots and consider trekking poles for stability. Footing can be uneven with roots and mud, so proceed carefully after rain. Some sections run along narrow lanes with occasional traffic; stay alert. Carry a map and compass (or reliable GPS), a fully charged phone with power bank, enough water and snacks, a first aid kit, whistle, and sun protection. In woodlands, ticks and insects can be present—check skin and clothing after the hike. Inform someone of your plan and expected return time.",
