    "summary": "Creag Noran Viewpoint Trail is a short, easy 1.2 km hike in the UK that leads to a scenic viewpoint. Suitable for beginners and families, it offers a gentle pace with minimal elevation gain and rewarding views at the summit.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route follows a well-maintained path with gentle gradients. Expect a mix of grassy paths and a few compact sections; footing is generally firm, with occasional rocky or rooty patches near the viewpoint. The trail is exposed at the summit, so head protection may be needed in windy conditions.",
