    "summary": "Allerdale Ramble is a demanding 30.4 km hike in the UK, designed for experienced walkers. The route combines long stretches of countryside trails with varied terrain and occasional road sections. Accurate navigation and good stamina are essential to complete this hard distance trek in a single day or over multiple stages.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of well defined footpaths, field edges, woodland tracks, and rough moorland in places. Elevation changes are steady but cumulative, with some exposed sections where weather can impact visibility. Footing may be uneven, with boggy patches after rain and occasional rocky steps. Depending on the route, you may encounter gates, stiles crossings, and occasional road walking.",
    "safety_notes": "General safety: This is a long and strenuous hike. Check the weather forecast and daylight hours before you go. Do not rely on mobile signal; carry a map and compass and know how to use them. Tell someone your planned route and expected return time. Start early to ensure you have enough daylight. Hydration and nutrition: bring ample water and high energy foods. Footwear and clothing: wear sturdy ankle support boots and dress in layers with a waterproof shell. Pack extra socks, hat, and gloves. Navigation and equipment: carry a detailed map, compass, and a fully charged phone as a backup; bring a headlamp and spare batteries. Safety gear: first aid kit, whistle, emergency blanket or bivy. In remote sections be prepared for sudden weather changes and fog; if conditions deteriorate, consider turning back or seeking shelter and safe options. Leave no trace and respect livestock and gates.",
