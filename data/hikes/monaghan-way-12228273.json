    "summary": "The Monaghan Way is a challenging long-distance hike in the UK, covering about 165.6 km. It is best tackled by experienced hikers due to sustained distance, variable terrain, and limited services along the route.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain varies from rural farmland tracks to woodlands and rolling hills. Expect uneven paths, potential muddy sections, and occasional road crossings. Navigation can be challenging in remote stretches, so carry a map and compass and be prepared for rapidly changing weather.",
    "safety_notes": "Safety should be the priority on this hard route. Ensure you are physically prepared for multi-day trekking, planning daily distances according to your pacing, and allowing for weather-related delays. Always carry navigation tools (map and compass or GPS), a fully charged phone, and a means to call for help. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected return. Stay on marked routes where possible; watch for boggy ground and livestock; keep hydrated with reliable water sources. Dress in layers and bring rain protection, as UK weather can be unpredictable. If conditions worsen or you feel unwell, turn back or seek shelter and reassess.",
