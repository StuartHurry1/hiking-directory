    "summary": "Harpley Circular Walk is a challenging 18.7 km loop in the United Kingdom. Designed for experienced hikers, the route combines varied terrain, long ascents and exposed sections that require a steady pace and solid navigation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of grassy paths, woodland tracks, muddy fields and occasional short road sections. Elevation gain is notable for a loop of this length, with some uneven surfaces and damp ground. Navigation helps due to sparse marker placement in parts of the route.",
    "safety_notes": "Prepare for a long day: check weather and daylight hours, and let someone know your plan. Carry a map and compass or GPS, plus a fully charged phone. Pack 2–3 litres of water, high-energy snacks, and appropriate clothing (layers, waterproof jacket, sturdy boots). Bring a small first aid kit, sun protection, a whistle and spare socks. Stay on public rights of way, be mindful of livestock, and be prepared for mud and potential boggy patches. In remote sections, have a backup plan and know how to contact help.",
