    "summary": "The Little Dart Ridge & Valley Walk is a demanding long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, spanning about 94 km and weaving along high ridgelines and through rolling valleys. Expect rugged trails, persistent ascents and descents, and expansive views. It suits experienced hikers with time for multi-day travel and strong navigation and weather planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Rugged upland ridges interspersed with valley floors. Expect rocky paths, exposed summits, heather moorland, and occasional boggy sections. The route demands steady footing, map-and-compass navigation, and careful pacing across long, uneven stretches.",
    "safety_notes": "Hard, long-distance route requiring good fitness and navigation skills. UK upland weather can change rapidly; be prepared for wind, rain, fog, and cold. Plan for multi-day trekking with overnight stops; carry an emergency shelter. Stay on the path, use a map and compass (GPS as backup) and know how to navigate in low visibility. Tell someone your itinerary and expected return; carry a charged phone as a last resort but do not rely on it. Expect exposed ridge sections; bring adequate water and high-energy food. Be mindful of wildlife and livestock; practice Leave No Trace.",
