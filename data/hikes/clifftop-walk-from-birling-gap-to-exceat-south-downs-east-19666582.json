    "summary": "A challenging coastal clifftop hike along the South Downs East, covering 22.4 km from Birling Gap to Exceat. Expect dramatic sea views, towering chalk cliffs, and long, steady ascents and descents. The route is exposed with variable footing and weather can make conditions harsh, so thorough preparation is essential.",
    "terrain_summary": "Cliff-top trails along chalk cliffs with uneven surfaces, exposed edges, and occasional steps. A mix of narrow paths, field tracks, and farm lanes, with rocky or muddy sections after rain. The scenery is stunning, but footing can be slippery and edges are dangerous in windy conditions.",
    "safety_notes": "Expect strong coastal winds and rapidly changing weather. Cliff-edge sections can be unstable or slippery; keep away from the edge and follow signs. Some stretches have limited shelter or escape routes between villages. Start early to ensure daylight, check local weather and any path closures, carry a map and a fully charged phone, and wear sturdy footwear with adequate waterproofing. Inform someone of your plans and ETA.",
