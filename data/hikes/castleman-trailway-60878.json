    "summary": "Castleman Trailway is a challenging long distance hike in the UK, spanning about 75.8 km along a former railway corridor. The route winds through woodland, heath and riverside scenery, with a mix of smooth paths, gravel tracks and occasional muddy sections. It can be split into multiple day stages with towns along the way for resupply and rest.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly flat to gently undulating paths along a former railway line, with sections of tarmac, compacted gravel and boardwalks. Expect some exposed heathland and woodland, occasional muddy patches after rain, roots and loose gravel, and a few street crossings where the trail meets towns. Surface quality varies by segment.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a multi day trek across long distances with limited remote sections. Check the weather and be prepared for wind and rain. Wear sturdy footwear and carry waterproof clothing. Carry sufficient water and high energy snacks, and know where to resupply in nearby towns. Carry a map, compass or GPS, and keep a charged phone with offline maps. Be mindful of other trail users such as cyclists on shared sections. Inform someone of your planned itinerary and expected finish time, especially if completing multiple days. In winter shorter daylight hours increase risk of being caught out after dark.",
