    "summary": "A challenging 63.8 km trek through the Mersey Valley timberlands in the UK. Classified as hard, the route traverses mixed woodland, damp trails, and varied terrain, best tackled as a multi-day hike with careful planning. Expect forest scenery, long stretches of muddy paths, and weather that can change quickly in temperate UK climates.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly forest track with rooty, uneven surfaces; frequent mud after rain; some gravel sections and occasional water crossings. Elevation changes exist but are cumulative rather than extreme; sections may be remote with limited support, so reliable navigation and self-sufficiency are important.",
    "safety_notes": "UK weather is highly variable; prepare for rain, wind, and cool conditions even in summer. Long distances between towns or services require preparedness for navigation and self-sufficiency. Carry a map or GPS, know your turnaround times, and inform someone of your itinerary. Wear sturdy boots, pack extra layers, water and high-energy food. Be mindful of ticks in woodland and follow Leave No Trace principles.",

    ],
    "best_seasons": "Spring to autumn are generally the best seasons for this UK forest trail, offering longer daylight and milder weather. Winter hiking is possible with proper gear and shorter days; always check conditions and be prepared for mud, ice, and wind.",
