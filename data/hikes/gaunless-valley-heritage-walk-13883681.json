    "summary": "A challenging 19.8 km circuit in the UK that combines historic sites with rugged countryside, suitable for experienced hikers prepared for long distances and varied terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rough footpaths, farm tracks, and occasional road sections. Surfaces can be uneven, muddy, and steep in places, with stiles, gates, and potential moorland exposure.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan your day and tell someone your route and timings. Navigation can be difficult in poor visibility—carry a map and compass (or a GPS device) and know how to use them. Weather in the UK can change quickly; bring waterproof layers and a warm layer. Wear sturdy, ankle-supporting boots, and pace yourself to avoid fatigue on the long distance. Stay on public paths, be mindful of livestock, and check for any access restrictions. Carry sufficient water and snacks; emergency whistle, first aid kit, and a charged phone (with offline maps). In winter, daylight is limited and conditions can be hazardous; consider shorter sections or alternative routes.",
