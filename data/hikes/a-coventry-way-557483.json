    "summary": "A Coventry Way is a demanding long-distance hike in the UK, covering about 227.8 km. It requires good navigation, steady stamina, and careful planning across varied rural landscapes, including farmland, hedgerows, and occasional road sections.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain varies from open farmland and country lanes to hedgerows and woodland edges. Expect some muddy sections, boggy ground after rain, stile and gate crossings, and a few longer road stretches. Elevation changes can add to the effort, with exposed sections possible in unsettled weather.",
    "safety_notes": "Because it is a hard multi-day trek in the UK, pre-plan with a route and overnight stops. Carry a map and compass (or GPS) and know how to use them. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours; be prepared for rain, wind, and cold even in summer. Tell someone your itinerary and expected return. Pack sufficient food and water, and have a backup plan for emergencies (whistle, first aid kit, thermal blanket). Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and bring blister care. Stay aware of daylight limits and pace yourself to avoid exhaustion.",
