    "summary": "Bittern Line Walk 5 is a challenging 15.6 km hike in the UK designed for experienced walkers. The route combines long distances with varied terrain and unspecified regional details, requiring good fitness and navigation skills.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect varied terrain across public paths and rural rights of way. Ground can be firm, grassy, or muddy after rain, with gentle to moderate climbs. Because the region is unspecified, conditions may range from flat sections to rolling terrain; always check local maps and current conditions before setting out.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for 15.6 km, allowing 4–6 hours depending on pace. Tell someone your route and expected return time; carry a map and compass or GPS; stay on designated paths and respect private property. Check weather and daylight hours; bring waterproofs and appropriate layers. In the UK, avoid stepping onto railway land or tracks; they are dangerous and trespassing is illegal. Bring enough water and food, a small first aid kit, a whistle, and a light source if visibility is likely to drop. Wear sturdy boots and adjust pace to conditions and fatigue.",
