    "summary": "Lundy Bay and Pentire walk is an 8.8 km coastal route in North Cornwall, UK, offering dramatic sea cliffs, sweeping ocean views and a mix of cliff-top paths, grassy lanes and occasional beaches. Beginning near Lundy Bay and looping toward Pentire Head, the hike suits walkers with moderate fitness who enjoy rugged coastline scenery and wildlife spotting along the Cornish coast.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied coastal surface: mostly cliff-top paths with exposed edges, uneven grassy tracks, and some steps and short boardwalk sections. Surfaces can be wet and slippery after rain, with rugged patches near headlands. The route features both open coastal heath and sheltered coves, so footing and weather can change quickly.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times and avoid stepping too close to cliff edges, especially in windy or wet conditions. Wear sturdy waterproof hiking boots with good grip and bring a windproof layer. Pack sufficient water and snacks, plus sun protection in warmer months. Let someone know your plan and be aware that mobile reception may be limited along parts of the coast. Stay on marked paths and respect any closures.",
