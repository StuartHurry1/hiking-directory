    "summary": "Ben Nevis Trail is a demanding long-distance hike in the United Kingdom. The route commonly covers about 32.2 km with substantial elevation gain. It traverses rugged highland terrain to reach and pass near Ben Nevis, offering dramatic summit views on clear days but exposed and weather driven risks throughout the ascent and descent.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain is varied and demanding. Expect rocky paths, scree slopes, peat bogs, and occasional scrambling. There are long open sections with exposure across the moor and steep ascents and exposed ridges near the summit. Weather can shift rapidly, bringing wind, rain, fog and cold. Navigation is important even on popular routes, as mist may reduce visibility. Sections can be wet and uneven underfoot. The distance makes this a long day on rough terrain.",
    "safety_notes": "- Weather in the Scottish Highlands can change quickly; check the forecast and plan contingencies. The summit and ridges are exposed; use proper clothing and sun protection. Falls and slips are a real hazard on rocky and scree sections; stay on marked paths and consider trekking poles. Navigation skills are important; carry a map and compass even if you have a GPS. Bring enough food and water; dehydration and fatigue can occur. Start early to maximize daylight and have an emergency plan. If conditions are severe, consider postponing or turning back; do not attempt if underprepared.",
