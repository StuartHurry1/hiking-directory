    "summary": "Gorge Trail is a short, 2.5 km hike in the UK suitable for beginners. The route follows a gorge riverbank along a well-marked path, offering accessible scenery and a relaxed pace.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily a well-maintained path along a gorge with gentle slopes. Expect occasional uneven ground, exposed roots, and some mud. The trail is overall easy and suitable for most walkers.",
    "safety_notes": "- Check local weather before you go; conditions near water and in gorge environments can change quickly. - Wear sturdy, closed-toe hiking shoes with good grip. - Stay on the marked path and respect barriers; keep a safe distance from edges. - Bring a light rain jacket and warmer layers; the gorge can be cooler and damper than surrounding areas. - Carry enough water and a small snack; inform someone of your plans if hiking alone. - Be cautious on muddy sections after rain and avoid shortcuts. - Keep pets under control and clean up after them where required. - In remote UK locations, mobile signal may be limited; carry a map or offline navigation.",
