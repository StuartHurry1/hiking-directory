    "summary": "A challenging 38.9 km long-distance parish walk that links Cringleford, Keswick and Eaton parishes in the United Kingdom. Suited to experienced hikers, the route traverses mixed rural and minor road sections with some elevation and variable footing.",
    "terrain_summary": "The walk mixes quiet country lanes, hedgerow-lined footpaths, field paths and occasional paved stretches. Expect uneven ground, stiles, gates and possible mud after rain. Elevation varies with gentle to moderate climbs, and some sections can be exposed to wind.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day: start early, check the forecast and daylight hours. Carry a map and compass or GPS, know bail-out points and stay on public rights of way. Wear sturdy footwear, bring weather-appropriate layering and waterproofs. Bring ample water and high-energy snacks, a small first aid kit, a fully charged phone with emergency contacts, and a power bank. Let someone know your route and estimated finish time. Be mindful of livestock on rural land, gates you pass through, and farm traffic. In poor conditions or if fatigue sets in, be prepared to shorten or turn back.",
