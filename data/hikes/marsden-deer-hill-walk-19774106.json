    "summary": "Marsden Deer Hill Walk is a demanding long-distance hike in the UK, covering about 21.3 km with significant elevation and exposed moorland sections. It suits experienced hikers who are prepared for changeable weather, rough terrain, and long hours on the trail.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses open moorland and hilltops with uneven, rocky ground, boggy patches, and occasional stream crossings. Expect long stretches of heather, strong winds on exposed sections, and steep ascents near the deer hill.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for 6–9 hours of hiking at a steady pace. Check the weather forecast before departure; UK moorland weather can change rapidly. Tell someone your route and expected return time. Carry a map and compass as a backup to digital devices. Stay on established paths, be prepared for boggy ground and ankle-deep water, and monitor weather; carry extra warm layers and waterproof gear. Bring enough water and food, and have a whistle or other signaling device for emergencies. In winter, shorter daylight hours and icy ground increase risk.",
