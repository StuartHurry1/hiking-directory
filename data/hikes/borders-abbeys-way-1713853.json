    "summary": "The Borders Abbeys Way is a demanding long-distance trekking route in the United Kingdom, roughly 200.4 km in length and designed for experienced hikers. The route links historic abbeys with rolling countryside, remote valleys, and border-country scenery, delivering considerable daily distances, elevation gain, and exposed sections. Expect a mix of rural lanes, moorland paths, woodlands, and occasional town or village detours, with cultural highlights at abbey ruins along the way.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied terrain mix: grassy uplands and moorland tracks, forest trails, ribbon-like country lanes, river valleys, and occasional road sections. The surface ranges from well-made paths to muddy, uneven ground; there are gentle approaches in some sections and steeper ascents in others, with stiles, gates, and potential boggy stretches after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a strenuous, multi-day route with long daily distances and variable weather factors. Plan carefully: map and compass or GPS, a planned daily itinerary, and accommodation or resupply points. Check local conditions, bring waterproof clothing, sun protection, extra layers, and sufficient food and water. Take care on exposed sections, road crossings, and in remote stretches where help may be far away; tell someone your plan; have a means of emergency communication. Tick-borne illness, wildlife, and uneven footing are potential hazards; cross-border sections may involve road walking or limits on public transport.",
