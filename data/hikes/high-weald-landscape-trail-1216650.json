    "summary": "The High Weald Landscape Trail is a strenuous long-distance hike through the High Weald area in southern England, spanning 675.6 km. The route winds across hedgerow-lined farmland, woodlands, chalk downs, and historic villages, offering varied scenery for experienced hikers. It requires good navigation, steady fitness, and reliable gear due to variable UK weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect chalk-down country, rolling farmland, ancient woodlands, river valleys, and long, uneven field paths. Trail surfaces include tracks, footpaths, and occasional road sections; mud is common after rain and hedgerows can make wayfinding tricky in places. While largely well-marked, some segments are remote with limited services.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan multi-day trips with clear routing and accommodation. Carry a topographic map and compass and know how to use them; GPS is helpful but not a substitute for navigation skills. Check the weather ahead of each stage; UK conditions can change quickly and can bring heavy rain and mud. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring extra socks and layers. Stay on public rights of way; close gates and be mindful of livestock. Carry sufficient water and high-energy foods; know water sources and have a way to purify water. Tell someone your itinerary and expected finish times; carry a charged phone as backup. In remote sections, consider a satellite messenger or emergency beacon. Carry a whistle, spare batteries, and an emergency shelter or space blanket. Be mindful of ticks and insects; use repellent. Follow Leave No Trace principles and respect private land.",
