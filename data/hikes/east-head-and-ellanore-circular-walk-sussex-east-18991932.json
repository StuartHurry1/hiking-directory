    "summary": "A 12.1 km circular coastal hike in Sussex East, UK, following the East Head dunes and the Ellanore coastline. The route is moderate in difficulty, with a mix of compact paths, sandy dune trails, and grassy tracks, offering sea views and varied scenery.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed coastal terrain: firm paths, soft sand on the dunes, grassy field edges, and short boardwalks. Expect uneven sections, occasional mud after rain, and exposed stretches where wind can be strong.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan ahead around tides and weather: check tide times and avoid the East Head spit at high tide; coastal sections can be exposed and slippery when windy. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring layered clothing for wind and rain. Carry water, snacks, and a map or GPS; ensure your phone is charged and you have a means of navigation. Stay on marked paths, watch for soft sand and dune edges, and avoid cliff or dune collapse areas. Mobile reception can be patchy; inform someone of your route and expected return time. Be mindful of wildlife and livestock on rural sections and respect the environment.",
