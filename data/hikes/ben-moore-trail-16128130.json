    "summary": "A challenging 21.4 km hike in the UK suitable for experienced walkers. The route features long sections of exposure, significant elevation gain, and varied terrain that can be muddy and rocky. Navigation and preparation are essential.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a rugged mix: grassy tracks, rocky steps, boggy moorland, and occasional scree. Elevation is substantial with sustained climbs and descents. Conditions can change quickly; mud and wet grass are common, especially after rain. In poor visibility, navigation may be difficult.",
    "safety_notes": "Check local weather and daylight; UK weather can change rapidly. Tell someone your plan and expected return. Wear sturdy, ankle-supporting boots and carry waterproof clothing. Bring enough water and high-energy food. Carry a map and compass or a reliable GPS, and do not rely on a phone alone. Have a charged phone as a backup. Include an emergency whistle and basic first aid. If conditions deteriorate or you feel exposed on higher ground, consider turning back.",
