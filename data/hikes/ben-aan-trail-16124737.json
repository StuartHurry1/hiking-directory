    "terrain_summary": "The trail follows a well-defined path with a mix of dirt and gravel at the lower sections, becoming steeper and rockier near the summit. Expect uneven, rocky steps and some loose stones; the final ascent is on exposed, rocky ground.",

Stay on marked paths, wear sturdy footwear with good grip, and bring water and a light layer. Supervise children, watch for loose rocks, and avoid the summit in high winds or icy conditions. If you’re unsure of conditions, turn back and inform someone of your plans.",
