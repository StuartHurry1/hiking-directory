    "summary": "A challenging coastal long-distance trek along the England Coast Path from North Gare to South Bents, covering about 141.3 km. The route tracks varied coastlines with cliffs, beaches, estuaries and tidal flats, offering dramatic sea views but demanding solid planning, fitness and weather tolerance.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rugged cliff and toe-paths, sandy beaches, dune systems, mud flats at low tide and occasional tidal crossings. Some sections are exposed to wind and spray, with uneven surfaces, wet grass and loose stones. Elevation changes are persistent but variable, and long stretches may have limited shelter or services. Always account for tides and navigation in remote coastal segments.",
    "safety_notes": "Check daily tide times and potential coastal closures before starting. Some stretches can be cut off by tides or erosion, requiring detours or temporary return. Carry a map and compass or a reliable GPS, plus a charged phone with offline maps. Travel with a companion when possible, inform someone of your plan, and carry a basic first aid kit, whistle, and emergency blanket. Stay hydrated, protect against sun and rain, and be prepared for sudden weather changes and strong coastal winds. Respect wildlife and stay away from cliff edges and unstable ground.",
