    "summary": "Kingley Vale Nature Trail is an easy 3.4 km circular hike through an ancient yew forest on the South Downs in the UK. The route is gentle and suitable for most hikers, including families, with mild elevation change and scenic viewpoints across the downs.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly well-maintained paths across chalk downland and woodland, featuring a mix of gravel and dirt trails with some uneven sections and exposed roots. Muddy conditions are possible after rain, and there are gentle slopes rather than steep climbs. Some sections are more exposed, so sun protection is advised.",
    "safety_notes": "Stay on marked paths to avoid unstable ground near the downs' edges. Wear sturdy footwear for uneven surfaces and potential mud. Weather on the South Downs can change quickly; bring layers and a waterproof if rain is forecast. Carry sufficient water, a basic first-aid kit, a map or GPS, and a charged phone. Be aware of other hikers and wildlife, and supervise children near edge areas.",
