    "summary": "The Hebden Bridge Loop is a 14.5 km moderate ridge walk in the UK. It circles the Hebden Bridge area, combining exposed ridge sections with woodland paths and moorland stretches, returning to the start for a rewarding circuit with varied scenery.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of ridge paths and stony trails with some exposed sections, occasional boggy ground after rain, and short woodland sections. Elevation gains are gradual to moderate, with occasional steeper pitches on ridges. Footing may be uneven and mud can be present in wetter months.",

Stay on marked trails, bring a map and compass (or offline mapping), and carry a charged phone. Let someone know your plan, carry a whistle and a basic first aid kit, extra water and food, and be prepared for reduced mobile signal in remote sections.",
