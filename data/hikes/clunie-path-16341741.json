    "summary": "Clunie Path is a challenging 22.7 km hike in the UK, featuring varied terrain, substantial elevation changes, and remote sections. It suits experienced hikers with good fitness and navigation skills, and it rewards perseverance with long-distance scenery. Expect a full-day trek with potentially exposed sections and sections where footing may be uneven.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines rough tracks, grassy moorland, rocky slabs, and boggy or marshy patches. Footing is uneven and can be slippery after rain. Some sections are exposed to wind with open views, and navigation aids (map and compass) are advisable as signage may be sparse in remote parts.",

Wear sturdy, waterproof footwear and dress in layers; carry a waterproof layer. Bring a map and compass (or a GPS device) and know how to use them. Take enough food and water for the day, and inform someone of your planned route and expected return. Be prepared for changing conditions, boggy ground, and potentially remote sections with limited mobile reception.",
