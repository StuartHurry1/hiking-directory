    "summary": "Camel Trail is a challenging long-distance hike in the UK, covering 93.1 km along a scenic, mostly flat river corridor. The route demands proper pacing and multi-day planning due to the distance, with steady footing and minimal elevation gain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain: A wide, well-maintained rail-trail surface (gravel/compact path) running along the Camel River. Predominantly flat with gentle gradients, but expect exposed sections and potential mud after rain. Be aware of other trail users (cyclists, horses) and occasional road crossings.",
    "safety_notes": "Because the hike covers 93.1 km, plan for multiple days and realistic daily distances. Check weather and daylight forecasts in advance; UK conditions can change quickly. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and dress in layers; carry sufficient water (2–3 L per day) and high-energy snacks. Stay aware of other trail users and keep to the side; heed any posted closures. Carry a map and compass or GPS with a backup; bring a charged phone and power bank. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected return. In remote sections, mobile signal may be unreliable; carry a whistle and emergency blanket. Respect wildlife and pack out all waste.",
