    "summary": "The Camp Castlecary Circuit is a 10.2 km moderate circular hike in the UK. The route weaves through a mix of woodland, open moorland, and river-side sections, offering steady elevation and rewarding views at key points along the way.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a combination of well-kept paths, damp grassy stretches, and short rocky steps. The surface ranges from compact gravel and boardwalks to soft earth; some sections can be muddy after rain. The route is largely non-technical with gentle climbs and descents.",

Stick to marked paths, watch for livestock or uneven ground, and start early enough to finish before dark. Let someone know your plans and expected return time.",
