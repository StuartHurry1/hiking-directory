    "summary": "A challenging 84.8 km coastal trek along the King Charles III England Coast Path from Sea Palling to Weybourne. This hard, exposed route follows the North Norfolk coast over beaches, shingle shores and headlands, demanding steady stamina and good navigation through variable weather. Expect long days on uneven surfaces, strong coastal winds and remote stretches between villages.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly coastal path with a mix of flat and gently rolling terrain. Long shingle beaches, tidal flats and exposed sections dominate, interspersed with boardwalks, paths along sea walls, grassy dunes and occasional gravel lanes. Surface can be uneven, slippery when wet, and soft in sand or mud after rain; occasional cliff-top viewpoints with short steep sections.",
    "safety_notes": "Coastal exposure means sudden changes in weather; always check tide times and avoid beach sections that are affected by tides. Some stretches are remote with limited mobile reception; carry a map or GPS and let someone know your itinerary. Wear sturdy footwear, bring layers and waterproofs, sun protection in summer, and plenty of water and snacks. Watch for erosion and unstable ground, follow marked paths, and be mindful of wildlife and wind-blown spray; consider shorter day-hikes if weather conditions worsen.",
