    "summary": "Cave Hill Trail is a 10.3 km moderate loop in the United Kingdom (region currently unknown) featuring a mix of woodland paths, grassy ridges, rocky outcrops, and occasional cave features along the route. Expect variable terrain and several viewpoints, with some ascent and descent throughout the hike.",
    "terrain_summary": "Varied terrain including well-marked woodland tracks, grassy slopes, exposed rocky sections, and muddy areas after rain. Footing can be uneven with occasional short, steeper climbs; some cave areas may have low ceilings and uneven ground. Gloves and sturdy boots with good grip are advisable.",
    "safety_notes": "Check weather before starting; UK conditions can change quickly. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and bring layered clothing. Stay on marked paths; be cautious of slippery rocks, especially after rain. Some sections may be exposed to wind; use sun protection in bright conditions. Do not enter caves without permission or proper guidance. Carry a map and compass or GPS, a fully charged phone (signal may be limited), a headlamp or flashlight (with spare batteries) for cave areas, and inform someone of your planned route and timing.",
