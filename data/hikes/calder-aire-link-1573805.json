Plan your day with realistic timings and share your route with someone. Bring enough food and water for the day (plus backups), and consider water treatment options for longer sections. Wear sturdy boots and weather-appropriate clothing, and pack a waterproof layer. Be prepared for remote terrain, limited mobile coverage, and changing conditions; know your limits and turn back if safety is compromised.",
