    "summary": "A challenging 42.4 km long-distance hike along the Gritstone Trail from Rushton Spencer to Kidsgrove, weaving across gritstone edges, moorland, and rural lanes in the UK.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect rugged gritstone edge sections, uneven rocky paths, and muddy tracks. The route includes exposed uplands with potential wind and rain, plus occasional farmland with gates and stiles. Distances accumulate quickly, and elevation can be significant.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a remote route with limited services in sections. Check weather forecasts as conditions can change rapidly on exposed gritstone edges. Wear sturdy, grippy footwear and carry a map and compass (GPS is helpful but not a substitute). Bring ample food and water, appropriate clothing, a headlamp, and a basic first-aid kit. Be mindful of livestock and gates, and respect access rights and landowners.",
