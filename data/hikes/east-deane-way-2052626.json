    "summary": "The East Deane Way is a challenging long-distance trail in the United Kingdom, spanning 158.7 km and rated hard. The route traverses varied rural landscapes and offers multi-day trekking with demanding sections and remote stretches. It is best tackled by experienced hikers prepared for fatigue, navigation challenges, and changing weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rural fields, hedgerows, woodland tracks, and occasional moorland-style terrain. The route includes rolling hills, uneven paths, and some muddy sections; long days without services are possible in remote stretches.",
    "safety_notes": "Before setting out, check the forecast and daylight hours. Carry navigation tools (map, compass, and a charged GPS); tell someone your itinerary and expected finish. Plan for long days with limited access to services; bring sufficient water and high-energy food. Wear sturdy footwear, dress in layers, and be prepared for sudden weather changes. Watch for livestock on rural tracks and follow right-of-way rules. In late autumn and winter, shorten or split stages to avoid very short daylight periods.",
