    "summary": "An epic coastal traverse along the England Coast Path from East Head to Shoreham, covering about 162.5 km in the UK. This hard, exposed route follows varied shorelines and demands good endurance, navigation, and careful planning for multi-day exposure to wind, tides, and weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "The hike traverses shingle beaches, dune systems, grassy cliff paths, and chalk coastal sections. Expect uneven footing, soft sand, exposed ridges, tidal mudflats in places, frequent wind and spray, and limited shelter on some stretches. Navigation is important as coastal markers can be sparse in remote segments.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan around tides and weather; some sections can be cut off by rising tides or rough seas. Stay aware of wind exposure on exposed promontories. Mobile coverage is limited in remote areas, so carry a map and compass in addition to GPS. Allow for longer daylight hours in favorable seasons and have backup cash and a first aid kit. Respect private land boundaries and local access rules.",

    ],
    "best_seasons": "Late spring to early autumn (roughly May to September) offers the best mix of daylight, milder weather, and safer sea conditions. Winter crossings are more challenging due to storms, high winds, and erosion risk.",
