    "summary": "A long, demanding 17.8 km hike in the UK, suitable for experienced hikers with good fitness and navigation skills. Expect varied terrain and a remote feel, with potential exposure and several hours on the trail.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses mixed terrain including grassy moorland, rocky paths, and uneven footing. Expect boggy sections and occasional exposed ground on higher sections; navigation can be remote in places.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for rapidly changing UK weather. Carry map and compass in addition to any electronic devices; don’t rely on a phone for navigation. Inform someone of your plan and expected return. Bring enough water and energy; snacks and a little extra in case of delays. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and layered clothing; be prepared for wind, rain, and cold. Watch for boggy ground and loose rocks; take care on exposed or uneven sections. In high winds or poor visibility, consider delaying or avoiding exposed ridges. Carry a small first aid kit, whistle, and emergency blanket or bivouac. Allow extra time; this is a long, strenuous day.",
