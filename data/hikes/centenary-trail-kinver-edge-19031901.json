    "summary": "The Centenary Trail at Kinver Edge is a 12.9 km moderate hike that weaves along the ridge lines of Kinver Edge, offering sweeping views across the surrounding countryside. The route combines sandstone cliff edges, open uplands, and wooded sections with a steady mix of ascents and descents, making for a classic UK ridge walk.",
    "terrain_summary": "Ridge and cliff edge terrain on sandstone formations, with exposed sections and uneven footing. Expect rocky steps, grassy paths, and forest tracks. Paths can become muddy after rain, and winds along the high sections can be strong; stay away from ledges and maintain distance from cliff edges.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for weather and daylight; ridge sections can be exposed to wind and rain, so wear sturdy footwear and dress in layers. Stay on marked paths, keep a safe distance from cliff edges, and supervise children and dogs. Mobile signal may be limited in remote sections; have a map or GPS. Tell someone your route and expected return time. In case of an emergency, call 999 or 112 in the United Kingdom.",
