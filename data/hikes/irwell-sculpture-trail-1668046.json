    "summary": "The Irwell Sculpture Trail is a 132.5 km long-distance hike in the United Kingdom that follows the River Irwell through a mix of urban streets, historic industrial landscapes, and scenic riverside countryside. Classified as a hard route, it offers intermittent sculpture installations and varied terrain that challenge multi-day trekkers, with sections across towns and rural banks requiring careful planning and versatile footwear.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed terrain including paved city paths, canal/river towpaths, grassy trails, woodland footpaths, and occasional roads. Expect urban sections with traffic, muddy or uneven surfaces after rain, and gentle to moderate elevation changes. Long riverfront stretches may have limited amenities; navigation relies on waypoints and river corridor signage.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multi-day hiking with appropriate daylight. Check weather forecasts and local conditions, as UK weather can be unpredictable. Stay on marked paths, be mindful of busy road crossings and industrial areas, and carry navigation tools. Inform someone of your itinerary and have a plan to shorten or exit via public transport if needed. Pack layers for varying temperatures and rain, bring sufficient water and food, and have a basic first aid kit and emergency plan.",
