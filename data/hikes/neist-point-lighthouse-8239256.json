    "summary": "Neist Point Lighthouse offers an easy coastal walk of about 3 km round trip along dramatic cliffs on the Isle of Skye. The route rewards visitors with sweeping sea views, basalt stacks, and chances to spot seabirds, making it a popular sunset destination. The terrain is gentle overall, but exposure to wind and uneven surfaces means appropriate footwear and caution near cliff edges are advised.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail is a well-defined coastal path of gravel and compact dirt with some rocky steps. It climbs gently from the car park to the lighthouse and then along a headland with exposed viewpoints. Parts of the route are uneven and windy, with occasional loose scree near the edge.",
    "safety_notes": "Coastal weather can change rapidly; check forecast before you go. Stay well back from cliff edges and do not rely on barriers. Wear sturdy footwear and dress in layers; bring a waterproof layer. Mobile reception can be patchy; tell someone your plans and carry a map or offline navigation. Watch for crowds, especially at sunset, and keep dogs under control where allowed.",
