    "summary": "A demanding 36.6 km loop-style walk around Maidenhead in the UK, combining riverside towpaths, rural lanes and occasional urban stretches. The route offers scenic Thames Valley views but requires stamina and careful pacing due to its length and mixed terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Surface varies from compact towpaths and gravel paths to quiet country lanes and grassy trails. Expect a few muddy sections after rain and several stiles or small steps. Elevation is gentle overall with some undulations rather than steep climbs.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan as a full-day hike (or split into two shorter legs). Carry enough water and snacks; weather can change quickly in the Thames Valley. Wear sturdy boots and weather-appropriate clothing. Use a map or GPS, as some sections are poorly signposted. Stay on public paths, be mindful of cyclists on towpaths and road crossings. Check daylight hours; inform someone of your route; mobile coverage can be patchy in rural sections. In icy or wet conditions be prepared for slippery surfaces and mud.",
