    "summary": "The Clytha Short Circular Walk in the Usk Valley is a 7.3 km circular route in the UK countryside, offering a moderate level of effort through a mix of rural lanes, fields, and woodland. The route provides scenic views of the valley and Clytha Park, with gentle hills and varied terrain, suitable for walkers with a reasonable level of fitness seeking a well-rounded half-day hike.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail combines grassy and dirt paths, field edges, and occasional road sections. Expect uneven footing, gaps and stiles, and some muddy stretches after rain. The surface is generally firm but can be slippery in wet conditions. The route is not technically demanding but moderate elevation changes and gates/stiles require steady footing and a bit of care.",
    "safety_notes": "Wear sturdy footwear and weather-appropriate clothing. Check local weather and field conditions before setting out. Stay on marked paths, watch for livestock on farmland, and use gates and stiles safely. Mobile reception may be limited in rural parts of the valley; carry a map and compass as a backup. Bring sufficient water, snacks, and a small first aid kit. Inform someone of your plan and expected return time. Dogs should be under control, especially where livestock are present.",
