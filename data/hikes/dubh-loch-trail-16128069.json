    "safety_notes": "Plan as a long day hike or multi-day trek with a realistic timetable. Tell someone your route and expected return. Bring a map and compass (or GPS with offline maps), and know how to use them. Carry sufficient water and high-energy food. Check the forecast; UK weather can change quickly. Wear sturdy boots, layer appropriately, and have a waterproof layer. In remote sections, have a plan for emergencies; carry a whistle, a basic first aid kit, a lightweight bivy or emergency blanket, and a means of signaling for help.
