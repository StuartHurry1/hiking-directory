    "summary": "A challenging 16.1 km circular hike from Gressenhall to Beetley and back, featuring rural lanes, farmland, and mixed terrain. The route is long and physically demanding, with uneven surfaces, possible mud, and some gentle climbs requiring good stamina and careful footing.",

Stay hydrated and bring snacks; carry a small first aid kit and emergency whistle. Check daylight hours and weather before setting out; avoid too-long winter traverses in fading light.",
