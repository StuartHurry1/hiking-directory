    "summary": "A challenging 21-kilometer circular hike around Cudham, featuring ridge sections and exposed ground in the UK. The loop starts and ends at the same point, demanding stamina, navigation, and careful footing on uneven terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mainly ridge paths with exposed sections, uneven grassy and rocky footing, and occasional boggy patches. Expect long ascents and descents with open moorland and hedged markers.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a strenuous, remote-feeling hike with long distances between landmarks. Navigation on ridges can be tricky; carry a map and compass and know how to use them. The weather in the UK can change rapidly—plan for wind, rain, and cold, even in summer. Start early to ensure daylight, and tell someone your planned route. Bring sufficient water and food, and have a plan for returning to the start if conditions worsen.",
    "recommended_gear": [
      "Sturdy, waterproof hiking boots with good grip",
      "Layered clothing (base layer, insulating layer) and a waterproof outer shell",

      "Walking poles (optional but helpful on rough ridges)"
    ],
    "best_seasons": "Late spring to early autumn typically offers the best conditions for this 21 km ridge walk. The route can be tackled in winter with proper preparation, but expect shorter daylight, stronger winds, and more mud and exposed sections.",
