    "summary": "A challenging 20.9 km circular hike around Kinder Reservoir, looping beneath Kinder Scout in the Derbyshire Peak District. The route combines exposed moorland, rocky paths, and occasional woodland stretches with long ascents and sweeping reservoir views. Suitable for experienced walkers with good navigation and fitness.",
    "terrain_summary": "Varied terrain including rough moorland tracks, exposed ridges, rocky steps, peat bogs and damp, muddy sections. Expect significant elevation gain, long ascents and descents, and sections where ground can be very soft or slippery, especially after rain. Navigation skills are important as paths can be faint in poor visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "This long upland route can be challenging in changeable weather. Check the forecast and start early in winter. Carry map and compass (GPS is useful but not a substitute). Wear sturdy waterproof boots and plenty of layers; bring extra food and water. Stay on marked paths to protect the ground and avoid bogs. Be prepared for sudden wind and cold on exposed sections; inform someone of your planned return time. Always carry a whistle and a charged phone; in an emergency call 999/112.",
