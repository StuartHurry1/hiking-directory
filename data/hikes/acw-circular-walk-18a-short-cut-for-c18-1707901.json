Bring a map and compass (GPS as backup), fully charged phone, waterproof clothing, sturdy hiking boots, and sufficient food and water (2–3 L). Tell someone your plan and expected return. Watch for remote sections with limited mobile signal, livestock on farm tracks, and potentially hard footing after rain. If conditions worsen, be prepared to turn back.",
