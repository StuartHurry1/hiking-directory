    "summary": "The North Sperrins Way is a hard 21.1 km ridge hike featuring exposed upland sections, rugged footing, and remote scenery. It suits experienced hikers with solid navigation skills and good fitness, as weather can change quickly in the UK.",
    "terrain_summary": "Rugged upland ridges with grassy paths, rocky outcrops, boggy patches, and variable footing. Expect exposed sections, long ascents and descents, and remote stretches where shelter is limited; navigation can be challenging in poor visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a strenuous, exposed route. Check the forecast and wind speeds before you go; avoid severe weather. Carry a map and compass as a backup to GPS, and inform someone of your plan and expected return. Start early to ensure daylight, and bring a headlamp. Wear sturdy boots with good grip, consider trekking poles, and pack extra warm layers, waterproofs, food, and water. Be prepared for bogs and uneven ground; in remote sections cellular coverage may be limited and emergency help could take time.",
