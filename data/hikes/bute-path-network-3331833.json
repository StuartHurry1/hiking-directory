    "summary": "A challenging 66.2 km long-distance hike through rural landscapes in the United Kingdom. The Bute Path Network offers a strenuous itinerary for experienced walkers, combining diverse terrains and potentially variable weather. The exact region is not specified, so use caution with navigation and accommodations; the route can be split into 2–3 days depending on pace and planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail covers a mix of surfaces including country lanes, gravel and peat tracks, woodland paths, grassy moorland, and occasional coastal segments. Expect elevation changes, uneven ground, and muddy conditions after rain. Navigation relies on markers and maps; be prepared for occasional remote sections with limited facilities.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan in advance with up-to-date maps and weather forecasts. Start early to maximize daylight; carry a fully charged phone as a backup but rely on maps and compass for navigation. Wear sturdy boots and waterproof clothing; be prepared for sudden UK weather changes. Tell someone your itinerary and expected return, and have an emergency plan for remote sections. Stay hydrated, manage fatigue, and know your limits—this is a long and hard route.",
