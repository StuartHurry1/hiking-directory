    "summary": "Frome Valley Way is a demanding long-distance footpath in the UK, totaling 128.9 km. The route winds along river valleys, through farmland, woodlands, and occasional limestone escarpments. It rewards persistence with varied scenery and frequent changes in terrain. Designed for experienced hikers, the trek is typically spread over 5–7 days, with overnight stops in villages along the way.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of riverbank paths, grassy towpaths, muddy sections, rocky tracks, and gentle ascents to higher ground. Some sections may be overgrown or poorly marked; navigation skills are helpful. Weather can change quickly, so waterproof footwear and layered clothing are essential. Seasonal farming gates and occasional road crossings can affect pacing.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long-distance route with remote sections and variable weather. Plan days carefully, share your itinerary, and check local conditions. Carry a map and compass (or GPS) and know how to use them. Ensure adequate daylight for each day, bring a first-aid kit, emergency shelter, and sufficient water and food. Be mindful of fatigue, livestock, and wildlife; mobile coverage can be limited in rural stretches.",
