    "summary": "Eglish Heritage Trail is a challenging 55.3 km route through rural UK landscapes, combining long-distance walking with opportunities to encounter local heritage and countryside scenery. The route is best approached as a multi-day trek due to its distance and terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rural lanes, country footpaths, fields, hedgerows and occasional forested sections. Elevation varies with some steep sections; footing ranges from compact lanes to uneven trails, gates and stiles. Weather in the UK can affect footing and visibility, especially after rain.",
