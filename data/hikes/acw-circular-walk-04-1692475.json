    "summary": "ACW Circular Walk 04 is a demanding 38 km circular hike in the UK. Rated hard, the route traverses varied terrain in an unknown region and tests endurance, navigation, and weather resilience.",

Wear sturdy boots and carry navigation tools (map, compass or GPS) and a fully charged phone. In an unknown region, signs may be sparse—bring a physical map as backup.
