    "summary": "The New River Link is a scenic 9.4 km trail in the UK that follows a historic waterway network. Classified as moderate, it suits walkers with a reasonable level of fitness and steady footing. The route combines urban green spaces with quiet riverbank paths and features gentle elevation changes rather than steep climbs.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of surfaces: paved paths, compacted dirt, and some gravel sections. Riverbank segments can be muddy after rain, and there may be raised boardwalks or uneven steps at bridges. Overall elevation is gentle, but occasional short climbs and gradual ascents can occur as the route connects different sections.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the weather and daylight hours before you go, as UK conditions can change quickly. Wear sturdy footwear with good grip and bring waterproof layers. Carry a map or GPS, a charged phone, and a small first aid kit. Stay on marked paths, watch for slippery edges near the water, and let someone know your planned return time. Be mindful of others in urban sections and supervise children or dogs near road crossings and busy areas.",
