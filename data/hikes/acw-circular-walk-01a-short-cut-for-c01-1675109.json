    "summary": "ACW Circular Walk 01A is a 17.3 km hard circular hike in the UK, offered as a short-cut variation for C01. It combines sustained distance with varied terrain for a demanding day on the trail.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses mixed UK trail surfaces: well-maintained paths, grassy fields, potential mud and boggy sections, rocky stretches, and multiple steep ascents and descents. Navigation is generally straightforward, but signage can be sparse in remote sections; be prepared for uneven footing and occasional stream crossings.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for long daylight hours and changing weather. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers. Carry a map and compass or GPS and know how to use them. Bring ample water and high-energy snacks. Pack a lightweight rain shell and a warm layer. Stay on marked paths, respect livestock, and check for any access restrictions. Inform someone of your planned route and expected return. Mobile signal may be limited in remote stretches. Carry a whistle, first-aid kit, and a charged phone/power bank for emergencies.",
