    "summary": "Green Link Walk (Section 3) is an approximately 8 km moderate hike in the UK, forming the middle portion of the longer Green Link Walk route. This section typically features a steady, mixed surface with gentle elevation changes and scenic glimpses of rural scenery, making it suitable for hikers with some experience and good footwear.",

If livestock or gates are encountered, close gates behind you and respect local rules. Inform someone of your plans and expected return.",
