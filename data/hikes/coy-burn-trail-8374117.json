    "summary": "Coy Burn Trail is a short, easy 5.6 km hike in the UK that follows a pleasant burn (stream) through relatively gentle countryside. The route is suitable for beginners and families, with mostly flat to gently undulating terrain and scenic views along the water.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail uses well-defined footpaths and grassy paths. Expect occasional muddy patches after rain, short sections of gravel or compact soil, and a few boardwalk or stony crossings near the burn. There may be gentle gradients but no technical scrambling.",
    "safety_notes": "Always check local weather before you go; UK conditions can change quickly. Wear waterproof footwear and a weather-appropriate layer, as paths near water can be muddy and chilly. Stay on marked trails, watch for uneven sections, and be mindful of livestock or cyclists on shared paths. Bring a map or GPS, a charged phone, and enough water and snacks. If you encounter crossings near water, take care with wet surfaces and avoid risky crossings.",
