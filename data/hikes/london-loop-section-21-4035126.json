    "summary": "London LOOP (Section 21) is a 19.5 km section of the London LOOP long-distance path in the United Kingdom. This hard-rated route traverses mixed terrain including urban segments, woodland trails, and rural footpaths, with elevation gain and several road crossings. Suitable for experienced walkers with good navigation and stamina.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines woodland tracks, grassy paths, and occasional surfaced lanes. Expect uneven footing in forest sections, occasional mud after rain, short steep ascents/descents, and some exposed sections. Potential for busy road crossings where the path leaves and re-enters urban areas.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for variable UK weather, daylight hours, and possible crowds in urban stretches. Stay on official path, watch for traffic at road crossings, and bookmark easy bailout points. Bring a map or GPS, know the route, and inform someone of your plans. In remote sections, mobile coverage may be patchy; carry a fully charged phone and a basic first aid kit.",
