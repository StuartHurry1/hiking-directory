    "summary": "Centenary Circle is a challenging long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, covering 61.5 km with a hard difficulty rating. The route traverses varied terrain and requires careful planning, strong navigation, and good physical conditioning.",

Pack a first aid kit, emergency shelter, headlamp, whistle, and waterproof gear. Have sun protection, gloves, and extra clothing for temperature changes. Be prepared for river crossings, mud, and variable trail conditions; know when to turn back if conditions deteriorate.",
