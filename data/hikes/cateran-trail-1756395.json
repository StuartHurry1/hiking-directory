    "summary": "An epic long-distance route in the UK, the Cateran Trail covers 174.5 km of varied Scottish scenery. This hard-paced circuit links woodlands, moorland, rivers and farmland, rewarding endurance with sweeping views, forest trails, and interior country lanes. Expect long days, significant ascents, and remote stretches where navigation and preparation matter.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mix of forest tracks, open moorland, grassy uplands, country lanes, and rocky paths. Expect uneven surfaces, boggy sections after rain, and some steep climbs. The route is mostly waymarked but navigation skills and a map are advisable, as sections can be remote with limited facilities.",
    "safety_notes": "Prepare for changeable UK weather, even in summer. The trail runs through remote sections with limited services—carry water, food, and a means to navigate. Wear sturdy boots and bring layers; pack waterproofs and emergency gear. Plan daily distances, share your itinerary, and consider not hiking alone. Check local conditions, be mindful of cattle and livestock on farmland, and have a plan for emergency communication in remote areas.",
