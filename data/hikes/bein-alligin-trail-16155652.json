    "summary": "Beinn Alligin Trail is a scenic 10.6 km circuit in the Scottish Highlands, offering dramatic mountain scenery and a rewarding ridge walk. The hike combines grassy paths and rocky sections, with some hands-on scrambling along the Horns of Beinn Alligin. It's best suited for fit hikers who are comfortable with uneven terrain and changing weather, and it rewards with expansive views over Torridon, Loch Maree, and the surrounding peaks.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily rocky and uneven trails with several exposed ridge sections on the Horns of Beinn Alligin. Expect a mix of stony paths, grassy trods, and short scrambling segments where using hands helps with balance. The route can be wet and slippery after rain; loose rock and scree may be present in higher sections. Navigation is straightforward on a clearly signposted path, but be prepared for remote, exposed terrain and rapidly changing weather.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for mountain weather that can change quickly. Wear sturdy, grippy boots and bring layers, including waterproof outerwear. Carry a map and compass or GPS, plus a fully charged phone as a backup. Stay on the marked route; some sections require basic scrambling and good footing. Do not hike alone if possible; tell someone your plan and expected return. Check forecasts before starting and be prepared to turn back if conditions deteriorate. In winter, snow and ice require mountaineering gear.",
