    "summary": "A challenging coastal circuit around the Isle of Wight spanning 267.3 km, featuring rugged cliffs, sandy beaches, and exposed headlands. The hard-difficulty route demands substantial stamina, solid navigation, and tolerance for variable UK sea weather, rewarding you with dramatic sea views and diverse coastline across the island.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily coastal path terrain with cliff-top routes, shingle and sand beaches, grassy tracks, and occasional road sections. Expect uneven surfaces, strong winds, and elevation changes along sea cliffs; mud after rain; some sections may require careful footing or tide-aware planning.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan multi-day legs with appropriate rest; check up-to-date weather and sea state forecasts and tides before each leg. Carry reliable navigation tools, a fully charged phone, and a means of power; notify someone of your itinerary; wear waterproof clothing and sturdy footwear; stay hydrated, snack regularly, and have a small first aid kit and whistle. Be cautious near cliff edges, slippery surfaces, and changing coastal conditions; avoid restricted or erosion-prone areas and adjust plans for daylight and seasonal hazards.",
