    "summary": "Kett's Country Walk is a challenging long-distance hike in the UK, covering 49.2 km. It features varied countryside and sustained effort, with fields, hedgerows, woodlands, and occasional road sections. Designed for experienced hikers, the route is typically undertaken over multiple parts or days depending on pace.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines firm tracks, grassy paths, muddy sections in wet weather, stiles, gates, and hedgerows with gentle to moderate elevation changes. Surfaces vary by section, so sturdy boots with good grip and preparedness for uneven ground are essential. Navigation may rely on waymarkers, local maps, and a compass.",
    "safety_notes": "UK weather can be unpredictable; check forecasts and daylight hours before starting. Carry a detailed map and compass as backups to devices. Share your itinerary with someone and plan for potential overnight stops if completing in multiple days. Stay hydrated and carry sufficient food. Be mindful of livestock, gates, and farm tracks; close gates behind you. Watch footing on uneven ground, be cautious near road sections, and keep left on public rights of way. If conditions deteriorate or you encounter an emergency, seek shelter and contact emergency services if needed.",
