    "summary": "A demanding 65 km section of the England Coast Path from Camber to Folkestone in Kent, UK. This coastal trek combines exposed cliff-top trails, shingle beaches, salt marshes, and seaside towns. Expect long days on uneven footing, exposure to wind and sun, and changes in weather; plan for multiple days and possible overnight stops. The route delivers dramatic sea views, chalk cliffs, and diverse habitats along a rugged coastline.",
    "terrain_summary": "The terrain is a mix of cliff-top paths with occasional steep steps, chalk or limestone escarpments, boardwalks over marshes, and shingle or sandy beaches. Footing can be uneven and slippery when wet; tidal and weather conditions may close sections. Expect long, exposed sections with sea spray and strong winds, as well as gentler stretches through towns and harbour areas. Distances between amenities can be long, so plan water and food accordingly.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times and weather forecasts before each stage; some beach sections depend on tides and may be impassable at high tide. Stay away from cliff edges, especially in wet or windy conditions; coastal erosion can alter paths. The coastline has remote stretches with limited mobile service—carry a map, compass, and a charged device; let someone know your itinerary and expected return. Carry sufficient water, sun protection, and emergency gear; be prepared for sudden temperature changes and strong winds.",
