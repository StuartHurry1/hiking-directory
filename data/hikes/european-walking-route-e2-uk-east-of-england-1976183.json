    "summary": "A challenging long-distance section of the European E2 route through the UK's East of England, covering about 213 km. Expect a mix of flat fenland, river valleys, woodlands, farmland, and several lakes. The route passes through rural villages and market towns, demanding solid stamina, navigation skills, and careful planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly flat to gently rolling fenland and river-valley terrain, with sections on canal towpaths, farm tracks, woodland trails, and marshy ground. Expect long flat stretches, potential mud, flood risk after rain, and occasional road or village sections. Signage can vary, so carrying a map and compass is advised.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan sections between services carefully, as rural East of England can have sparse amenities. Weather can be changeable; carry layered clothing and waterproofs. Navigation can be tricky in featureless fenland, so bring a map and compass (and a charged GPS as backup). Be aware of potential floods, mud, and ticks in long grass; carry a first aid kit and blister care. Stay hydrated; carry enough water and know water sources. Be mindful of traffic on country lanes and ensure high-visibility clothing if walking near dusk. Let someone know your itinerary and check daylight hours.",
