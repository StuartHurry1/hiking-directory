    "summary": "Chesterfield Round Walk is a challenging 73.6 km circular hike in the UK. This hard-distance trek follows a continuous loop through varied countryside, demanding good navigation, stamina, and multi-day planning. Expect long daily distances, diverse terrain, and potential weather changes.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines quiet lanes, farm tracks, bridleways, moorland, and woodland paths. Expect uneven, stony sections, grassy slopes, several steep ascents and descents, and occasional boggy ground after rain. There are gates and stiles, exposed stretches on higher ground, and some road crossings; navigation skills and map-reading are strongly recommended.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multi-day hiking with adequate daylight. Carry a current map and compass or GPS, and check weather and daylight hours before setting out. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers. Pack sufficient water and high-energy food. Bring a first aid kit, whistle, and emergency blanket. Inform someone of your route and expected return; mobile signal can be limited in remote sections, so be prepared to self-rescue or seek assistance. Stay on rights of way, respect livestock, and take care on road crossings.",
