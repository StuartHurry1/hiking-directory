    "summary": "The Cumbria Coastal Way is a demanding long-distance coastal route along the UK’s Cumbria coast, spanning about 491 km. It combines rugged cliff paths, beach sections, and exposed coastal moorland with frequent sea views and variable weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect sections of steep, rocky cliff trails, eroding paths, beach and tidal shores, wet grassy moors, stony shorelines, and some road crossings. Navigation can be tricky in fog or rough seas; several parts are exposed to wind and rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times for sections that cross beaches or require river/estuary crossings. UK coastal weather can be severe and change rapidly—bring adequate clothing and a waterproof layer. Wear sturdy boots with good grip; stay away from unstable cliff edges and wet rocks after rain. Carry a map and compass (or GPS), plus a charged phone, power bank, and a means for signaling emergencies. Plan for limited services along the route and arrange accommodation or camping in advance. Inform someone of your plan and expected timings.",
