    "summary": "A challenging multi-day coastal trek along the Norfolk coast as part of the King Charles III England Coast Path, running 73.3 km from Hopton-on-Sea to Sea Palling. Expect exposed headlands, sandy beaches, salt marshes and tidal estuaries, with rugged cliffs and panoramic sea views. The route is hard due to long distances, variable weather, and mixed terrain, requiring good navigation and fitness.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route follows the England Coast Path across Norfolk's coastline: a mix of windswept headlands, shingle beaches, dune systems, grass paths, boardwalks, and occasional tarmac sections. Surfaces range from compact paths to soft sand and muddy estuary crossings; expect exposed open sections with strong winds, uneven footing on coastal cliffs, and potential flooding at high tides.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multiple days with appropriate navigation skills. Check tide times for estuary crossings and be prepared to backtrack or detour. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected return. Weather on the coast can change rapidly; carry waterproof layers, sun protection, and a basic first aid kit. Mobile signal can be patchy in remote sections; carry a map and compass as backup. Stay clear of cliff edges, watch for erosion, and respect wildlife. Carry extra food and water; daylight hours vary by season.",
