    "summary": "Cape Wrath Trail is a renowned long-distance trek in Scotland, covering roughly 248.6 km from Fort William to Morvich via Invergarry. It traverses rugged Highland landscape, including lochs, moorland, forests, and remote coastal sections, demanding stamina, navigation, and resilience to variable weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain ranges from boggy moorland and peat flats to rocky ridges, forest tracks, and river crossings.

Carry detailed map and compass (GPS backup), know your route and tide times for coastal sections, and inform someone of your itinerary.
