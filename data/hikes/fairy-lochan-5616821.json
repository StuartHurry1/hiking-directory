    "summary": "Fairy Lochan is a 6.5 km hike in the UK with a moderate difficulty. The route offers a mix of countryside tracks, woodland sections, and open moorland, with gentle elevation changes. The region is listed as unknown, so expect variable scenery and footing. Suitable for hikers with some experience and solid footwear.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed surfaces: well-trodden woodland paths, grassy moorland, and occasional rocky steps. Ground can be uneven and muddy after rain, with slippery patches near streams or boggy areas. There may be stiles and small ascents; elevation is moderate. Overall, the terrain is manageable for a moderate hike if you wear proper footwear and watch your footing.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the forecast and daylight hours before you go. Wear sturdy, waterproof hiking boots and dress in layers; UK weather can change quickly. Carry a map and compass (or GPS) and know the planned route; stay on marked paths to protect fragile habitats. Bring enough water and high-energy snacks. Pack a small first‑aid kit, a whistle, and a headlamp or flashlight in case of delays. Let someone know your plans and check mobile signal, as remote sections may have limited connectivity. Practice Leave No Trace: take all rubbish with you, keep dogs under control, and respect wildlife. In winter or after heavy rain, expect mud, boggy ground, and slick surfaces; adjust pace and footing accordingly.",
