    "summary": "A demanding, multi-day long-distance hike around Leeds in the United Kingdom, covering 221.6 km on a mix of countryside lanes, footpaths, canal towpaths and rural tracks. Classified as hard, it requires strong stamina, reliable navigation, and careful planning for weather and accommodation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly rural countryside with hedged fields, farm tracks, woodlands, canal towpaths, and occasional moorland or hill sections. Surface quality varies from well-made paths to muddy, uneven tracks; expect gates, stiles, and occasional road crossings. Weather and mud can slow progress, especially after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multiple days with a defined itinerary and share it with someone. Carry a map and compass as primary navigation tools and use GPS/offline maps as backup. Check the forecast and be prepared for rapid weather changes; wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring warm layers. Stay alert near road sections, respect livestock and private land, and follow rights of way. Pack sufficient food and water, plus a means to purify water. Include a first aid kit, whistle, and emergency shelter; know how to contact emergency services (999/112) in the UK.",
