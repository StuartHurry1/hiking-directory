    "summary": "The Nene Way is a challenging long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, spanning roughly 523 km. The route traverses a mix of countryside, towpaths, farmland, woodland, and occasional urban sections, requiring stamina, careful planning, and self-sufficiency for multi-day marches.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain is varied: paved or compact towpaths, riverbanks, gravel tracks, muddy fields, hedged lanes, and woodland trails, with rolling to moderate elevation changes. Weather in the UK is unpredictable, so waterproofing and suitable footwear are essential across seasons.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for long days and potentially remote sections with limited services. Carry navigational tools (map, compass, or GPS) and a contingency plan if signs are scarce. Check local weather and flood risk, especially near rivers. Stay aware of daylight hours, carry lighting for early starts or late finishes, and let someone know your itinerary. Bring a basic first aid kit, sufficient food and water, and a means to call for help in case of emergencies.",
