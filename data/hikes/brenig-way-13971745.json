    "summary": "Brenig Way is a demanding long-distance hike in the UK, covering 59.3 km. The route weaves through varied terrain and exposes hikers to sustained effort, navigation challenges, and weather variability, making it best suited for experienced trekkers who can complete a multi-day trek or a strenuous single-day push.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rough tracks, forest paths, exposed upland sections, and occasional road stints. The terrain can be muddy after rain, with uneven surfaces, rocky steps, and potential boggy moorland. Significant elevation changes occur in parts, with long ascents and descents.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a multi-day trek or a long, strenuous day. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours before you go. Carry map and compass (or a reliable GPS) and know how to navigate. Stay on marked paths, and be prepared for sudden weather changes and reduced visibility. Bring enough food and water, wear sturdy boots and layered clothing, and have a plan for emergency shelter. Tell someone your route and expected finish time, and carry a charged mobile phone as a backup. In remote sections expect limited signals; consider a satellite messenger for emergencies. Manage fatigue and blisters; adjust pace to conditions.",
