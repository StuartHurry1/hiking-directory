The route offers scenic forest scenery with a mix of compact and soft ground, suitable for hikers with a reasonable fitness level.

    "terrain_summary": "The route follows a well-maintained woodland track with sections of compact gravel, soft earth, and occasional exposed roots. It may be muddy in wet weather and includes gentle gradients, gates where livestock or crofting land intersect the path, and occasional boardwalks.",
    "safety_notes": "Before you go, check the weather forecast and daylight hours. Wear sturdy, waterproof footwear and dress in layered clothing suitable for changing conditions. Stay on marked paths, and be prepared for muddy sections after rain. Gates may open onto crofting land with livestock; close gates behind you. Mobile reception can be unreliable in remote woodland, so carry a map and compass or a GPS device, and let someone know your planned route and ETA. Bring water, snacks, a small first aid kit, a whistle for emergencies, and a headtorch if you expect to be out near dusk.",
