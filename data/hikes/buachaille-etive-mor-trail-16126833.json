    "summary": "The Buachaille Etive Mor Trail is a 13.9 km moderate hike in the Scottish Highlands, United Kingdom. It circles the Buachaille Etive Mor massif, offering expansive mountain views, grassy slopes, and rocky paths suitable for hikers with some experience. The route is scenic and popular, with variable weather requiring careful preparation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of well-defined paths, rocky steps, grassy ascents and descents, and occasional scree. Higher sections can be exposed and wind-prone; boggy patches and small stream crossings may occur after rain. Navigation is straightforward on a clear day, but mist can reduce visibility near the ridge.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in the Scottish Highlands can change rapidly; always check a reliable forecast and be prepared for cold wind and rain. Wear layered clothing, waterproofs, and sturdy boots. Carry a map and compass (GPS as backup) and know how to use them. Stay on marked paths and turn back if visibility worsens or conditions become unsafe. Start early to avoid late returns, and inform someone of your plan. Mobile reception may be limited in remote areas; carry a charged phone and emergency contact information. In winter, plan for ice and shorter daylight hours and consider an experienced guide for exposed sections.",
