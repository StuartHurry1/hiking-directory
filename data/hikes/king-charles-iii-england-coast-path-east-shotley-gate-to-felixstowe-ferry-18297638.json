    "summary": "A challenging coastal hike along the King Charles III England Coast Path from Shotley Gate to Felixstowe Ferry. The 15.7 km route follows exposed sea cliffs, sea walls and expansive marshes, offering dramatic views of the North Sea and the Felixstowe estuary. Expect a persistent uphill and downhill profile, exposed sections, and variable footing as you traverse coastal paths, grassy cliff tops, and marsh edges.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain combines rugged coastal paths, uneven stony sections, grassy cliff tops, boardwalks, muddy estuary margins, and salt marsh. Some footing can be slippery near the waterline, with potential waterlogged or boggy stretches after rain. The route is exposed to wind and sea spray; expect frequent changes in footing and occasional stairs or steps in built sections.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times and avoid crossing exposed mud flats at high tide. Stay on marked paths, watch for unstable ground near cliff edges, and be prepared for strong coastal winds. Carry a map and compass or GPS, and tell someone your plan and estimated return. Have appropriate gear for cold and wet conditions, bring extra layers, and turn back if weather deteriorates or visibility drops.",
