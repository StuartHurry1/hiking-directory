    "summary": "A strenuous, remote Scottish Highlands traverse covering about 216.6 km from Kinlochewe to Inchnadamph. The Cape Wrath Trail offers wild landscapes, rugged ridges, lochs, peat bogs and long days with significant elevation changes in a sparsely populated setting.",
    "terrain_summary": "Remote Highland terrain with boggy moorland, rocky paths, exposed ridges, river crossings and lengthy stretches between settlements. Navigation skills are important, and weather can be unpredictable and severe even in summer.",
    "safety_notes": "Navigation is essential: carry a detailed map and compass and know how to use them. Weather in the Scottish Highlands is highly changeable and can be severe; bring waterproof and insulating layers. Plan for multiple remote days with limited resupply; carry extra food and know water sources and purification methods. Inform someone of your route and expected timeline; carrying a personal locator beacon or satellite messenger is recommended. River crossings and wet moorland can be hazardous after rain; be prepared to adjust or turn back. Overnight camping is common; practice Leave No Trace and camp where permitted. Fatigue, exposure, and wildlife are factors; pace yourself and monitor symptoms of altitude or cold stress if relevant.",
