    "summary": "Fallows Trail is a demanding 37.2 km hike in the UK, classified as hard. It traverses a mix of rural paths and remote sections, requiring solid fitness, navigation skills, and thorough preparation to complete in a day or as a multi-day trek.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines long stretches of undulating footpaths, stony tracks, grassy climbs, hedged lanes, and occasional mud. Expect uneven footing, exposed sections, and moments of rough ground where navigation or footing matters. Surface quality varies with weather and season; some sections may be overgrown or poorly marked.",
    "safety_notes": "Prepare for a long, hard trek. Plan for a day-long or multi-day outing. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours; UK weather is changeable. Carry a detailed map and compass in addition to a GPS device. Inform someone of your plans and expected return. Carry ample water and high-energy food; allow extra for delays. Wear sturdy footwear with good grip and carry a rain jacket, insulating layers, and sun protection. Be prepared for navigation in remote sections where cell service may be unreliable. If you’re unsure of your fitness or conditions, consider breaking the hike into stages or turning back.",

    "best_seasons": "Late spring to early autumn (roughly April–October) are ideal for the Fallows Trail in the UK. Longer daylight hours and generally drier conditions improve safety and pace.
