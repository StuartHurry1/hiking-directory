    "summary": "A demanding ridge-to-ridge traverse from Kidsgrove to Stoke Ridgeway in the UK. At 52.6 km, it rewards with dramatic ridge scenery but requires high fitness, good navigation, and experience with exposed, backcountry terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Ridge-and-moors terrain with open, exposed sections. Expect rough, uneven paths, rocky outcrops, and possible boggy ground. Wind can be strong on exposed ridgelines; navigation aids like a map and compass are essential as waymarks can be sparse in sections.",
    "safety_notes": "Hard, long-distance route with significant elevation gain and exposed sections; plan for weather changes on ridges. Carry and know how to use a map and compass (GPS as backup). Stay on official paths; watch for rough terrain, bogs, and cattle. Start early to ensure daylight; tell someone your plan and expected return. Bring sufficient food and water, a first-aid kit, extra clothing, a waterproof layer, and emergency shelter. Wear sturdy boots and pack a headtorch; in UK emergencies call 999. Check access rights and local advisories before setting out.",
