    "summary": "Coleridge Link is a challenging 46.4 km ridge traverse in the United Kingdom. The route combines exposed high ridges, remote moorland, and varied terrain, typically completed as a multi-day trek. It demands good navigation, physical endurance, and respect for rapidly changing mountain weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect exposed ridge sections with uneven footing, rocky slabs, grass-covered cols, and occasional boggy patches. Terrain can be wind-swept and shelter is limited; route-finding on open ground is essential. Elevation gain is significant for a 46.4 km trek, with long stretches between notable landmarks.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in UK ridge environments can change quickly. Carry a reliable map and compass (don’t rely on electronics alone), inform someone of your itinerary, and check forecasts before departure. Pack extra layers, a waterproof shell, sun protection, a first aid kit, and an emergency shelter. Start early to maximize daylight, and consider a shorter option if visibility or wind is poor. In remote areas have a contingency plan and know escape routes.",
