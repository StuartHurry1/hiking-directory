    "summary": "The John Musgrave Heritage Trail is a demanding long-distance walk in the United Kingdom, spanning 504.9 km and presenting a hard challenge for experienced hikers. The route traverses varied landscapes and historic sites, demanding careful planning and strong endurance.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rural lanes, moorland tracks, forest paths, and occasional urban sections. Elevation gains and uneven footing are common, with potential boggy sections after rain and exposed highs depending on the route sections. Navigation is important across countryside and lesser-traveled paths.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a strenuous trek requiring solid fitness, navigation skills, and advance planning. Carry an up-to-date map and compass or GPS, inform someone of your itinerary, and check UK weather forecasts. In remote sections be prepared for limited mobile reception, sudden weather changes, and long stretches without services. Stay hydrated, pace yourself, and consider acclimatisation and rest days for a route of this length.",
