    "summary": "E2 (Humber Bridge) is a hard 17.6 km ridge hike in the UK. The route crosses exposed ridgelines with significant elevation gain, offering expansive views but demanding good fitness, navigation, and weather preparedness.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily ridge terrain with uneven, rocky paths and grass-covered sections. Expect exposed shoulders, steep ascents and descents, potential scrambling on loose material, and variable footing. Weather on ridges can change rapidly, with strong winds and reduced visibility possible.",
    "safety_notes": "This route involves long miles on exposed ridges and significant elevation. Plan for daylight hours, carry maps and a compass, and do not rely solely on phone GPS. Check weather forecasts, dress in layers, and wear sturdy boots with good grip. Start early to avoid poor light; in case of injury or deteriorating conditions, have a plan to seek shelter and call for help. Stick to marked paths, be cautious near edges, and consider trekking poles for balance on uneven ground.",
