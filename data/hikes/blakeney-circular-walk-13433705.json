    "summary": "A demanding 28.4 km circular hike in the UK that threads coastal paths, tidal marshes and inland lakes around Blakeney. The route offers expansive sea views, salty air and a mix of firm trails, grassy tracks and muddy sections, making for a strenuous day on foot.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly exposed coastal paths with occasional firm trails, muddy stretches across marshland, short sections of grass and boardwalks near wet areas. Expect variable footing, crosswinds, and water-logged ground after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times before venturing onto marsh or estuary sections; some parts may be inaccessible at high tide. Stay on marked paths and avoid private salt marshes. Weather can change rapidly along the coast—bring waterproofs and warm layers. A long 28.4 km trek requires good fitness; carry sufficient water and snacks. Let someone know your route and expected finish time; carry a map or GPS; mobile coverage may be patchy in remote stretches.",
