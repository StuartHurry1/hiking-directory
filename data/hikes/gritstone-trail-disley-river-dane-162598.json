    "summary": "A demanding 73.5 km long-distance hike along the Gritstone Trail from Disley to the River Dane. The route traverses rugged gritstone edges, open moorland, and forest paths, with long ascents and exposed ridgelines offering panoramic views but challenging footing.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily gritstone quarry and moorland tracks, with exposed ridgelines, rocky steps, and uneven, often muddy ground. Expect steep climbs, short rocky sections, and remote stretches where navigation and weather can change quickly.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard distance with significant elevation gain. Carry navigation tools and know the route, as some segments have limited waymarking. Weather in the UK can change rapidly; dress in layers and be prepared for wind, rain, and cold even in summer. Start early to maximize daylight. Inform someone of your plan and expected finish. Bring ample food and water; have a plan for emergencies. Use trekking poles if needed to reduce strain. Take care on exposed ridges, and avoid exposed rock when footing is uncertain or visibility is poor.",
