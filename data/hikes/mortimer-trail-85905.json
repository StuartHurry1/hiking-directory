    "summary": "The Mortimer Trail is a hard, 224.2 km long-distance route in the UK designed for experienced hikers. The trek runs through varied countryside on multi-day itineraries, with notable elevation gains and remote sections where services are limited.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed terrain: quiet country lanes, hedgerows and farmland, woodlands, open moorland, and some rocky or uneven paths. Long sections between settlements mean navigation and resilience are important, and weather can be unpredictable.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a demanding, multi-day route with remote stretches. Prepare thoroughly: carry a detailed map and compass and know how to use them, check up-to-date weather forecasts, and plan daily distances that suit your pace. Tell someone your itinerary and expected return, and carry a means to contact or signal for help. Pack appropriate clothing for cold, wet, and windy conditions, sufficient food and water, a first-aid kit, emergency shelter or bivvy, and a whistle. Stay on marked paths where possible, keep to daylight hours, and have contingency plans for sudden weather changes or injury.",
