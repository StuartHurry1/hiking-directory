    "summary": "Exe Valley Way is a demanding long-distance hike that traces the valley of the River Exe across the UK. At 675.2 km, it is a strenuous route designed for experienced trekkers seeking a substantial wilderness challenge.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines quiet country lanes, farm tracks, woodlands and some exposed hillside sections.

Carry navigation tools (map and compass, and optionally a GPS), a reliable light source, enough water and energy-rich food, and appropriate clothing for rain and cold. Some sections have limited mobile reception and remote terrain; consider hiking with a partner or arranging a support plan. Be mindful of livestock on farmland and respect local access rules. Ensure you have daylight to complete each day and carry a lightweight emergency shelter or space blanket.",
