    "summary": "A challenging 109.2 km coastal trek along the England Coast Path from Minehead to Combe Martin. Beginning on the Somerset coast and ending near Exmoor, the route blends cliff-top panoramas, sandy beaches, moorland sections, and charming coastal villages. It is a hard, multi-day hike with exposed coastal terrain and varied footing.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of cliff-top trails, rocky steps, grassy moorland, heath, and beach sections. Some stretches may be eroded or muddy, and tidal/shoreline crossings can require timing. Elevation includes long ascents and descents along sea cliffs with strong coastal winds. Footing ranges from compact paths to uneven rocks and exposed stretches.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard coastal route with exposure to wind and weather. Check forecasts and tide times; some sections may be affected by tides or be temporarily inaccessible. Navigation can be challenging along exposed coast—carry a map and compass or a reliable GPS device. Wear sturdy, grippy footwear and be prepared for mud, rain, and sudden weather changes. Plan multi-day logistics in advance, arrange accommodation or camping, and inform someone of your itinerary. Bring sufficient water and food, a basic first aid kit, and an emergency signaling device.",
