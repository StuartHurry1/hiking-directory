    "summary": "The Errol South Circular Path is a 10.2 km circular hike in the UK offering a moderate level of challenge. The route typically travels through a mix of rural lanes, woodland edges and open fields, returning to the start via a steady loop. Suitable for walkers with a reasonable level of fitness, it combines gentle ascents with flat sections and potential boggy or uneven stretches depending on recent weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed surfaces: compacted tracks, grassy paths, stiles and occasional road crossings. Some sections may be muddy after rain, and footing can be uneven where fields give way to woodland or hedgerows. The route is generally undulating but not steep, with a few gentle rises and descents.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the forecast before setting out and be prepared for UK weather variability. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and bring layered clothing, a waterproof layer, and a hat. Carry a map and compass or a GPS-enabled device, a fully charged phone, and water plus snacks. Let someone know your planned route and expected return time. Stay aware of livestock, cyclists, and other walkers, and take care at road crossings.",
