    "summary": "A challenging 24.8 km hike from Melford Hall to Lavenham, using the Lavenham Railway Walk and connecting lanes to pass historic sites such as the Lavenham Guildhall. The route exposes rural Suffolk scenery, from hedged lanes to quiet village streets, and rewards with views of countryside and medieval architecture along the way.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly rural with a mix of surfaced lanes, gravel paths, and grassy fields. Expect stiles, gates, occasional mud, and some road sections near villages. Elevation is steady but not extreme; long continuous stretches require solid fitness and good footing.",
    "safety_notes": "Long, hard-distance hike across rural terrain. Plan for several hours of walking and variable weather. Check forecast, wear appropriate footwear, and bring waterproof layers. Carry a map or GPS, a charged phone, and a way to contact others. Stay on designated paths, be mindful of farmland access rules, watch for livestock, and gate closures. Be cautious at road crossings and in areas with limited mobile signal. Tell someone your route and expected return time; if conditions deteriorate, shorten the route or turn back.",
