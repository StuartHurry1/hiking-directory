    "summary": "Hard 50 km long-distance hike along the Teesdale Way from Middleton in Teesdale to Middlesbrough. The route combines upland moorland, riverbank paths, and urban fringe, demanding steady navigation, endurance, and careful planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect varied terrain: upland moorland and limestone pavements near Middleton-in-Teesdale, rocky and muddy riverbank sections along the Tees, occasional disused railway and minor road segments, and urban approaches into Middlesbrough. Elevation changes, exposed stretches, and potential boggy or overgrown paths.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard, 50 km route. Consider splitting into two days or starting very early. Check weather forecasts; exposed moorland sections can be windy and cold. Carry map and compass; some sections have limited signage. Stay aware of traffic on road and rail heritage paths. Ensure you have enough water and food, and inform someone of your plan and timings. In remote segments, mobile signal may be unreliable.",
