    "summary": "A challenging 113.5 km loop around the Imber Range perimeter in the UK. The route traverses moorland and farmland and runs adjacent to a Ministry of Defence training area where access can be restricted on short notice.",
    "terrain_summary": "Rugged mix of chalky tracks, moorland, and long, open sections with uneven ground. Expect tussocky grass, boggy patches after rain, and sections near perimeters or through pastures. Navigation is essential as some paths are unmarked and access can change with MoD schedules.",
    "safety_notes": "Imber Range access is controlled by the MoD and may be restricted or closed without warning. Before attempting this route, verify official open days and obtain any required permissions. Stay on permitted paths, observe all signs, and avoid restricted zones. Carry a detailed map and compass (GPS as backup). Plan for remote stretches with long daylight gaps; carry ample water and food. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected finish time. Be prepared for sudden weather changes, wind exposure, and difficult footing. If access is denied, do not proceed.",
