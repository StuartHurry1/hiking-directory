    "summary": "Capital Ring (Section 10) is a 16.6 km long, hard-rated section of London's Capital Ring circular walk. The route weaves through a mix of urban streets, parkland, canal towpaths, and woodlands, delivering a varied day on foot with several exposed stretches and occasional elevation gain.",
    "terrain_summary": "The terrain is mixed: urban pavements and city streets interspersed with gravel canal towpaths, park trails, and woodland paths.

Start with ample daylight; if finishing near dusk, carry a light and high-visibility clothing.",
