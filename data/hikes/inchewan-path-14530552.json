    "summary": "Inchewan Path is a challenging 21 km hike in the UK that rewards experienced walkers with a long, varied route. The landscape is likely to include mixed terrain and potential exposure, so solid navigation and endurance are essential.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of forest tracks, grassy ridges, rocky sections, and muddy byways. Footing can be uneven and weathered surfaces slippery after rain. Depending on the region, you may encounter boggy ground, stream crossings, and modest ascents and descents along the way.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the forecast before you go; UK weather can change rapidly. Carry a detailed map and compass in addition to any electronic device, and don't rely on mobile coverage. Start early to ensure daylight, stay on marked paths, and tell someone your plan. Bring sufficient water and food, wear appropriate clothing, and carry a basic first-aid kit. In remote sections, consider a whistle and an emergency blanket.",
