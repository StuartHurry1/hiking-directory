    "summary": "High Force Geotrail is a 14.1 km moderate hike in the UK that loops around the High Force area along the River Tees. The route combines rocky riverbank paths, meadow trails, and gentle ascents with views of the waterfall and surrounding limestone geology. Plan for 4–6 hours at a steady pace; conditions can be wet underfoot, especially after rain, so suitable for hikers with moderate fitness and good balance.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed terrain: firm gravel and rocky tracks, sections of muddy fields, occasional stream crossings, and boardwalks. Expect uneven footing, exposed rock ledges, and short climbs or descents. The environment near the river can be wet and slippery; weather changes quickly, so waterproof footwear and outerwear are advisable. The trail is not technically difficult but some basic route finding and careful footing are needed.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the weather forecast before you go. River crossings can be slippery after rain and ground near the waterfall can be unstable. Stay on marked paths and keep a safe distance from the edge of cliffy sections. Tell someone your planned route and expected return time. Carry a basic first aid kit, a whistle, and a means of communication; bring a map or GPS device and ensure you have enough daylight to complete the hike.",
    "recommended_gear": [
      "Sturdy waterproof hiking boots with good grip",
      "Weather-appropriate clothing (layers, waterproof shell)",
      "Backpack with water and snacks",
      "Map and compass or GPS device",
      "Headlamp or flashlight (in case of late return or overcast days)",
      "Personal first aid kit",
      "Whistle and emergency signaling device",
      "Sun protection (hat, sunscreen, sunglasses)"
    ],
    "best_seasons": "Late spring to early autumn (roughly March to October) is ideal for this hike due to longer daylight and drier paths. Winter conditions can be cold, very wet, and slippery, with higher risk of slips and reduced visibility.",
