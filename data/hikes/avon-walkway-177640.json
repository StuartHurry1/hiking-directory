    "summary": "The Avon Walkway is a challenging long-distance hike totaling 57.8 km in the UK. The route traverses varied landscapes along the River Avon, mixing riverside paths, fields, woodlands, and occasional urban sections. Given its hard difficulty, the hike is typically undertaken as a multi-day trek with careful planning for distances, navigation, and weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed terrain: riverbank paths, muddy and grassy tracks, occasional chalky or compacted trails, gentle to moderate gradients, several gates or stiles, and periodic urban or industrial stretches. Footing can be uneven and exposure to mud is common after rain; sturdy, waterproof footwear and good navigation are recommended.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a multi-day trip if you are tackling the full 57.8 km. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours. Carry a map and compass (or GPS), fully charged phone, and a means of navigation. Inform someone of your itinerary, stay on marked paths, and be cautious at road crossings and in busy sections. Bring sufficient water and food, know your limits, and adjust plans if conditions are poor or sections are flooded or unsafe. Be mindful of private land and access rights and respect wildlife.",
