    "summary": "ACW Circular Walk 13C is a hard circular hike in the UK. A shorter 4-mile variant exists as an even shorter cut of route A, devised for the WWF event on 1-Jun-2006. The route is listed here at 15.6 km (about 9.7 miles) with regional details not specified; participants should be prepared for a longer workout or use the shorter variant as appropriate.",
    "terrain_summary": "The walk traverses varied UK countryside on rural lanes, footpaths, and field edges. Expect uneven ground, potential mud, intermittent ascents and descents, and occasional stiles. Terrain and drainage will depend on season and weather; plan for navigation across open country and private waymarks where permitted.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long, hard hike: check the weather, wear sturdy boots with ankle support, and bring navigation tools. Stay on marked paths where possible, respect private land, and keep dogs under control. Carry sufficient water and snacks, dress in layers with a waterproof outer layer, and have a map or GPS. Let someone know your route and estimated return time; carry a basic first aid kit and a whistle. If attempting the shorter 4-mile variant, ensure you follow the official cut and any permissions required for private land.",
