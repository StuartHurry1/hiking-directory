    "summary": "An engaging 9.3 km coastal ridge hike on the Isle of Wight, following the Fine Fortifications Trail between Bembridge and Culver Downs. The route blends chalk-down landscapes, dramatic sea views, and hints of historical fortifications, offering a moderate challenge for hikers with steady footing and a taste for coastal scenery.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily exposed chalk paths along rolling ridges with moderate ascents and descents. Expect dry, grassy sections, compact earth, and occasional steps. The trail runs near cliff edges in places, with uneven footing and potential mud after rain. Coastal winds are common on exposed sections; bring sun and wind protection.",
    "safety_notes": "Wear sturdy boots and stay on marked trails; keep a safe distance from cliff edges, especially in windy conditions. Weather can change quickly along the coast—bring layered clothing, a waterproof shell, and sun protection. Stay hydrated and carry a basic first aid kit and a map or GPS. Dogs should be leashed near cliff edges. Check for erosion and be cautious of loose chalk underfoot; if near beaches, be mindful of tides when extending your route.",
