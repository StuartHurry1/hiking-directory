    "summary": "A challenging 23.3 km link in the 1066 Country Walk, connecting Hastings/Bexhill areas to Bexhill. This hard-rated route combines coastal paths, farmland lanes, and inland tracks with significant elevation changes. Suitable for experienced hikers prepared for long days and variable UK weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "The hike features coastal cliff-top and shoreline sections, grassy trails, woodland stretches, and quiet country lanes with occasional road crossings. Expect uneven, rocky or muddy paths, exposed upland segments, and potential stiles. Elevation gains can be substantial in places, and footing can be slippery after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day (23.3 km) with variable weather. Check tidal conditions if passages cross shorelines. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring layers. Carry a map and compass (or GPS) and fully charged phone. Tell someone your route and expected return. Pack sufficient water and high-energy food, a first aid kit, headlamp, whistle, and a weather-appropriate shell. Watch for coastal erosion and farm gates; stay on marked paths. In late autumn to winter, daylight is limited; consider starting early or dividing the hike.",
