    "summary": "The North Wales Path is a demanding long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, spanning 343.2 km across northern Wales. The route combines coastal sections, remote moorland, forest trails, and rugged mountain passes, delivering a hard-difficulty trek that tests endurance, navigation, and weather resilience. Expect elevation gain, varied terrain, and extended periods away from towns, making preparation and pacing essential for completion.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied mix of terrain: cliff-top coastal paths and sandy shores, peat bogs and upland moorland, rocky ridges, forest trails, and occasional tarmac or gravel roads. The most challenging segments are exposed uplands and mountain passes where weather can change rapidly. Navigation can be tricky in remote sections, especially in poor visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a high-difficulty, long-distance route with remote stretches in the UK. Before starting, check weather forecasts and tide times for coastal sections, and plan for sufficient daylight. Carry a detailed map and compass as primary nav tools, with GPS as backup. Pack enough food, water, and a means to purify water; plan for bivouac or hostel/guesthouse stops. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected check-ins; have a whistle, emergency shelter, and a charged phone or satellite communicator in case of emergencies. In winter or poor conditions the route becomes significantly more dangerous; consider delaying or joining a guided or shorter alternative.",
