    "summary": "Medlock Valley Way is a challenging 18.6 km hike in the United Kingdom. The route traverses valley floors, woodlands, and rural tracks, combining scenic river views with sections of rough, uneven footing. Its hard difficulty reflects significant elevation changes and variable ground, making it best suited to experienced hikers with good footwear and navigation skills.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of terrain: riverside paths, grassy tracks, and sections of uneven, rocky ground. There are steep ascents in parts and potential mud, especially after rain. The route may include shallow water crossings and will be affected by seasonal weather; footing can be slick in damp conditions.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, strenuous hike. Plan for 4–6 hours depending on pace and conditions, with ample daylight. Wear sturdy hiking boots and dress in layers; UK weather can change rapidly. Carry enough water and high-energy snacks, plus a map and compass or GPS. Stay on marked paths, watch for muddy or slippery sections, and prepare for mud, wind, and rain. Let someone know your planned return time. In winter or poor visibility, daylight is shortened and navigation becomes harder; carry a flashlight and warm layers. If you encounter a crossing that seems unsafe, turn back and seek an alternative route. If you need emergency assistance, dial 999.",
