    "summary": "A remote, hard-grade long-distance trek along a Highland corridor in the UK, covering about 35.7 km between Glomach, Killian, and Bendronaig. The route combines rough tracks, peat bogs, river crossings, and exposed ridges, demanding solid navigation, fitness, and weather preparedness.",
    "terrain_summary": "The terrain features open moorland, rocky paths, boggy sections, and multiple river crossings. Expect steep climbs and descents, wind-exposed ridges on higher ground, and sections that can be muddy or waterlogged. Navigation is essential, as the trail can be indistinct in mist.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a remote and exposed route with limited mobile coverage; carry a personal locator beacon and inform someone of your itinerary. Weather in the Highlands can change rapidly; always check the forecast and be prepared for wind, rain, and cold. Navigation is essential; bring a map and compass and know how to use them, as some sections are poorly marked. Start early to ensure daylight and plan for a full day with a bailout option if conditions deteriorate.",
