    "safety_notes": "Plan for variable UK weather; check forecast and wear appropriate clothing. Wear sturdy waterproof hiking boots and bring a waterproof jacket and extra layers. Stay on marked paths and follow trail signs; some sections can be slippery when wet. Carry a map or offline navigation and know how to read it; mobile signal may be limited in deeper woodland. Inform someone of your plans and expected return time. Watch for other hikers and cyclists on shared trails. Protect against ticks and insects with repellent; check for ticks after the hike. Carry enough water and snacks for 13.6 km; know your limits and take breaks as needed. In winter daylight is limited; start early or adjust plan.",
