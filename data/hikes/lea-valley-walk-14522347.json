    "summary": "Lea Valley Walk is a challenging 100.2 km long-distance trail in the UK, tracing the River Lea through a mix of urban landscapes, canal towpaths and countryside. It demands endurance and careful planning, with varied terrain and weather conditions across a multi-day route.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a blend of canal towpaths, riverbanks, woodland paths, fields and some urban streets. Surfaces range from compact pavements to grassy and muddy sections. Elevation is moderate but the overall distance makes sections physically demanding, with potential water and mud after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan in stages, check the forecast and daylight hours, and notify someone of your itinerary. Wear sturdy footwear and weather-appropriate layers. Stay aware of traffic on road sections, navigation in urban areas, and river/water hazards along the Lea. Carry a map or GPS, a charged phone, a basic first aid kit, and a light source for early starts or late finishes. Hydration and nutrition are essential for long days; consider backup power and emergency contact details.",
