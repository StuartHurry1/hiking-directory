    "summary": "A challenging 20.3 km hike from Little Glenshee to Strathbraan in the UK, featuring upland routes, exposed ridgelines, and rugged moorland. The route demands solid navigation, good fitness, and careful weather planning, and is best undertaken by experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect rugged upland terrain with long stretches of peat bogs, uneven rocky paths, heather moorland, and intermittent water crossings. The route may involve steep ascents and descents, exposed sections, and sections where footing can be loose or wet. Navigation is essential, as the landscape can be feature-sparse in poor visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for rapid weather changes common in UK uplands. Check the forecast, carry sufficient clothing, and start early to ensure daylight. Bring map and compass, and know how to use them; do not rely solely on electronics in remote areas. Tell someone your planned route and expected return. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers with a windproof shell. Carry enough water and high-energy food. Pack a first aid kit, whistle, head torch, and emergency blanket. Be prepared for boggy ground, potential river or stream crossings, and loose or rocky footing. Mobile reception is often limited; consider a GPS device or offline map. If conditions are severe, turn back and choose a safer route.",
