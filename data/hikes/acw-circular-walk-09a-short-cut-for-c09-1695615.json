    "summary": "ACW Circular Walk 09A is a 24.6 km hard circular route in the UK, a cut-down variant of C09 designed for experienced hikers. The hike traverses a mix of open moorland, woodland paths, and occasional road sections, with challenging ascents and long straight sections that demand stamina and navigation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain varies from rough, uneven tracks and grassy moorland to forest trails and rocky lanes. Expect steep climbs, loose stones, boggy patches after rain, and exposure in open sections. The short cut nature adds potential wayfinding challenges where routes converge.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for long daylight hours or carry a headlamp. Weather in UK uplands changes quickly; check forecast before setting out. Tell someone your planned route and expected return. Carry a map and compass or a GPS device and know how to use them. Stay hydrated and carry enough food; pace yourself to avoid fatigue on long sections. Mobile signal can be sparse in remote parts; bring a power bank and consider a tracker. Avoid crossing livestock and be aware of seasonal closures.",
