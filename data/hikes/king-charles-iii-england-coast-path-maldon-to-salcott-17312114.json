    "summary": "A strenuous coastal traverse along the England Coast Path from Maldon to Salcott, covering 84.8 km. The route combines estuary shorelines, tidal flats, and low-lying coastal terrain with strong exposure to wind and tides, demanding solid navigation, endurance, and careful planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly coastal path with a mix of compact trails, mud, mudflats at low tides, boardwalks, and occasional gravel or dirt tracks. Expect open exposure, shifting sands, and water effects from estuaries; navigation may require following signs along a remote coastline.",
    "safety_notes": "Hard, long-distance coastal hike. Plan for multiple days or long daily distances. Check tide times and weather; some sections can be inaccessible at high tide. Wear sturdy waterproof boots with good grip; consider gaiters for mud. Carry enough water and energy-rich snacks; have a plan for shelter in bad weather. Bring a map, compass or offline GPS and a fully charged phone. Tell someone your route and expected times. Be prepared for sudden weather changes and sea spray; apply sunscreen and wear layers. Watch for muddy or slippery surfaces and close gates behind you when encountered.",
