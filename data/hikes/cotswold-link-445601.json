    "summary": "Cotswold Link is a challenging long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, spanning 169.2 km. The route traverses varied countryside with rolling hills, fields, woodlands, hedgerows and historic lanes, requiring solid fitness, navigation skills and several days on the trail. Weather in the UK can be unpredictable, so plan for changing conditions and allow for flexible itineraries.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed terrain: gently undulating to hilly countryside, rural lanes, stone paths, muddy field edges and woodland trails. Some sections are exposed to wind on higher ground; footing ranges from well-maintained paths to uneven stony tracks. Navigation aids are recommended as routes may diverge from signposted paths.",
    "safety_notes": "Prepare for a long-distance hike: plan multiple days, share itinerary with someone, carry a map and reliable navigation device, and bring adequate waterproofs and warm layers. Check weather forecasts; risk of mud, boggy sections after rain; potential for limited services in remote stretches. Stay hydrated, pace yourself, and be aware of daylight hours in shoulder seasons. Personal safety precautions apply if walking alone at night.",
