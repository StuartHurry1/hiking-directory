    "summary": "The Craignamaddy Circuit is a challenging 32.3 km circular hike in the UK. As a hard route, it traverses varied, exposed terrain over a full day of walking, with multiple ascents and long stretches of moorland and rocky ground. Expect remote sections, changing weather, and a need for solid navigation and fitness.",

    "safety_notes": "Carry a current map and compass (or a GPS device) and know how to navigate. Check weather forecasts and be prepared for sudden changes. Start early to maximize daylight and keep a steady pace to avoid exhaustion. Tell someone your planned route and timings. Stay hydrated, bring sufficient food, and carry a waterproof layer and warm clothing. In remote areas, be aware of navigation hazards, sudden bog, loose rocks, and exposure; carry a whistle and a basic first-aid kit.",
