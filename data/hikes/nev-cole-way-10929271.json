    "summary": "Nev Cole Way is a challenging long-distance route in the United Kingdom, totaling 221.5 km and rated hard. The trail traverses varied landscapes and can be demanding at altitude and distance, requiring solid navigation, good fitness, and careful planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect varied terrain typical of long-distance UK routes: a mix of farm lanes, tracks, hills, and potentially exposed sections.

Tell someone your itinerary, carry a fully charged phone with offline maps, and have a backup plan for emergencies. Ensure fitness and experience with long days, respect access rules on private lands, and check local conditions. Bring a first aid kit, whistle, and an emergency shelter or bivy bag; consider a personal locator beacon for remote sections.",
