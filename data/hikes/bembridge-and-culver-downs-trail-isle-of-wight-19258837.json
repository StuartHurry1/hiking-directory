    "summary": "A demanding 24-kilometre coastal ridge hike on the Isle of Wight, following Bembridge and Culver Downs with expansive sea views, chalk uplands, and rugged trails.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses chalk downland and exposed ridges with steep ascents and descents, uneven chalk tracks, and some gravel sections. Expect windy, open sections near the coast and cliff-top portions; surfaces can be loose and weather can change quickly, so navigation and steady footing are essential.",
    "safety_notes": "Stay on marked paths and away from unstable cliff edges on Bembridge and Culver Downs. Check the weather forecast and be prepared for sudden wind shifts and rain. Carry a map and compass or GPS, and a fully charged phone. Bring enough water and snacks, wear sturdy boots, and plan for a long day due to the 24 km distance. In poor conditions or limited daylight, shorten or split the hike. Keep dogs on a leash where required and watch for signage near sensitive cliff areas.",
