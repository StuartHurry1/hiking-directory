    "summary": "An ultra-long-distance hike through the UK covering 3,979.5 km. Rated hard, Monarch's Way demands exceptional endurance, self-sufficiency, and thorough planning across diverse terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route comprises a mix of rural lanes, farmlands, forests, moorlands, hills, and coastal paths.

Inform someone of your itinerary and expected schedule. Plan around UK weather, as conditions can change quickly. Ensure you have appropriate clothing, footwear, and energy reserves. Monitor fatigue and adjust pace to avoid injury. Identify exit options in case of bad conditions. Use Leave No Trace principles. Carry a first aid kit and know basic first aid. Be prepared for wildlife, road traffic, and road crossings, and consider a buddy or support crew if possible.",
