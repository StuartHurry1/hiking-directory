    "summary": "The Boudicca Way is a hard, long-distance UK trail covering about 232.7 km. It weaves through varied countryside, including rural lanes, hedgerow footpaths, and occasional woodland tracks, demanding substantial daily distances, solid navigation, and strong endurance.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied mix of surfaces: well-maintained footpaths, field margins, forest tracks, and occasional muddy or uneven sections. The route features rolling hills and exposed sections, with weather demanding readiness for wind and rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multi-day trekking with flexible itineraries; carry a map and compass or GPS, and know how to use them. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours, inform someone of your route, carry sufficient water and food, and have a means of emergency contact. In the UK, dial 999 for emergencies. Be prepared for muddy terrain, navigation challenges in rural areas, and varying weather; consider tent or bivouac gear if wild camping is allowed along the route and follow local regs.",
