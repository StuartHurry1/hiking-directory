    "summary": "Coilhallan Wood is an 11.6km moderately challenging hike through tranquil UK woodland. The route follows well-marked forest tracks with gentle elevation, offering shaded canopies, seasonal scenery, and opportunities for birdwatching and quiet reflection.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain consists of shaded forest paths with a mix of packed dirt, gravel, and occasional boardwalk. Expect some exposed roots and a few short ascents; footing is generally stable but can be muddy after rain. Elevation gain is gradual, with a few gentle hills rather than steep climbs.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for variable UK weather and shorter daylight hours in autumn and winter. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and a weather-appropriate jacket. Stay on marked trails, watch for slippery roots and mud, and be mindful of ticks in woodland. Carry a map or GPS, a charged phone, plenty of water, and a small first aid kit. Let someone know your route and expected return time; carry a whistle for emergencies; check local advisories for trail closures.",
