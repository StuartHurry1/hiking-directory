    "summary": "GM Ringway Stage 5 is a demanding 23 km segment of the GM Ringway long-distance path in the UK. It combines varied terrain and sustained ascent, testing fitness and navigation skills.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain is varied: rolling farmland, woodland trails, open moorland, and occasional rocky or muddy sections. Expect long sections of uneven ground, stiles and gates, and several road or track crossings. Navigation can be challenging in exposed or feature-poor sections, so carry a map and compass even if you have a GPS.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard stage suitable for experienced hikers. Plan for 6–9 hours depending on pace and conditions. Check the forecast and daylight hours before setting out. Wear sturdy, waterproof footwear and bring layered clothing. Carry a map and compass as primary navigation tools (GPS as backup). Stay on marked paths, take care on exposed or slippery sections, and watch for boggy ground after rain. Inform someone of your plans, carry a whistle and a fully charged phone, and bring a basic first aid kit, sufficient water, and high-energy snacks. Start early in winter to maximize daylight; in poor weather or fog, consider postponing or turning back.",
