    "summary": "A demanding 50.1 km hike through varied UK countryside along the Churnet Valley. The route blends quiet river paths, farmland tracks, and exposed sections, with several ascents and long, uneven stretches. Suitable for experienced hikers with strong endurance, ideally split into two or more days or tackled as long single-day sections with careful planning.",

Expect uneven, sometimes rocky surfaces and muddy stretches after rain, with notable elevation gain on several segments. Navigation is generally straightforward, but carrying a map and compass or GPS is advised in unknown stretches.",

A small first-aid kit, an emergency space blanket, and a means of communication with others are recommended. Inform someone of your route and expected finish time.
