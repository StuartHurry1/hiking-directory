    "summary": "The Essex Way from Epping to Stratford St Mary is a challenging long-distance hike of about 161.8 km on UK countryside paths. It traverses rural Essex with varying surfaces and multiple long-day stretches, demanding stamina, good navigation and careful planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly rural footpaths, hedged country lanes, farmland tracks and occasional canal towpaths. Expect a mix of flat stretches and gentle to moderate climbs, with mud possible after rain, uneven surfaces and exposed sections along farmland and river edges.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a multi-day trek with realistic daily distances. Carry a map and compass as GPS can fail in remote sections. Check weather forecasts and be prepared for wind, rain and cold. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring layered clothing, a waterproof layer, sun protection and a hat. Stay on marked rights of way, watch for road crossings and cattle, and be mindful of long stretches without services. Tell someone your itinerary and expected finish times. Bring enough water and high-energy snacks, a first aid kit, a headlamp with spare batteries, a whistle and a lightweight emergency blanket or bivy.",
