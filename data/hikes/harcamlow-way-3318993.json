    "summary": "The Harcamlow Way is a challenging long-distance footpath in the United Kingdom, covering about 514.4 km. It traverses rural England via a mix of farmland, woodlands, canal towpaths and hedged lanes, with variable terrain and several ascents. Suitable only for experienced hikers who can manage navigation, long days of hiking, and periods without services.",
    "terrain_summary": "Variable terrain including well-trodden fields and tracks, muddy and grassy sections after rain, canal towpaths, woodland paths, occasional road stints, and multiple stiles/gates. Expect uneven surfaces, hedgerows, and longer stretches with little shelter or services; navigation aids recommended.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan ahead for resupply and accommodation on a 500+ km route. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours. Carry a map, compass, or GPS, and inform someone of your itinerary. Wear sturdy boots and bring weather-appropriate clothing. Be prepared for mud, isolated stretches with limited phone signal, and road crossings. Watch for livestock, adjust pace to fatigue, and have contingency plans for shelter in bad weather. Carry a basic first aid kit and emergency contact method.",
