    "summary": "London LOOP (Section 5) is a 16 km segment of the London LOOP around London, UK. Classified as hard, it passes through a mix of countryside and urban fringe terrain and is best suited to experienced hikers with good stamina and navigation skills.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route features varied surfaces typical of a long-distance loop: a mix of well-defined footpaths, grass and dirt tracks, possible muddy sections, woodland edges, and occasional urban fringe stretches. Elevation changes may occur, and stiles or gates can be encountered. Expect uneven ground and changing conditions depending on weather and season.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a full-day hike with daylight to spare. Check weather and trail conditions and be prepared for mud, wind, and rain. Carry navigation tools (map/compass or GPS), a charged phone, and a light source if there is any chance of low light. Tell someone your plan, know escape routes, and stay on waymarked paths. For longer stretches, carry sufficient water and snacks, and be mindful of fatigue on a hard section.",
