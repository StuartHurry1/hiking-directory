    "summary": "Milton Keynes Boundary Walk is a demanding 202-kilometre loop that traces the outer edge of Milton Keynes and its surrounding countryside. The route combines urban fringe paths, quiet lanes, farmland, woodlands and nature reserves, requiring solid navigation and endurance. Depending on pace, completing the walk typically spans multiple days, with a mix of long road sections and more rugged trails.",
    "terrain_summary": "Varied terrain: urban fringe streets and country lanes, farm tracks, grassy field margins, woodland paths, and damp, muddy sections after rain. Surface quality ranges from smooth tarmac to uneven footing; expect gates and stiles, occasional water features, and some remote stretches with limited amenities.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan thoroughly with weather and daylight in mind; carry a map and compass as backups to GPS. Let someone know your plan and expected finish times. Be prepared for remote sections with limited mobile coverage, carry sufficient water and food, and wear sturdy boots. Take care at road crossings, watch for livestock on farmland, and adjust pace to conditions. Respect private land and obey gate closures.",
