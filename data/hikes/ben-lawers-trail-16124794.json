    "summary": "A demanding 34 km circuit in the Scottish Highlands around Ben Lawers, offering high-alpine scenery, exposed ridges, and long, steady ascents. Suitable for experienced hikers with strong endurance, navigation skills, and a weatherproof kit.",
    "terrain_summary": "Rugged mix of rocky paths, boggy moorland, exposed ridges, and occasional short scrambling. Expect steep climbs, uneven footing, and rapidly changing weather. Some sections are above the tree line and exposed to wind; carry a map and compass and be prepared to turn back if visibility drops.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the forecast and daylight hours; the weather in the Highlands can change rapidly. Plan for a long day (8–10 hours) and inform someone of your route. Stay on marked paths where possible; carry a map and compass (and know how to use them) or a GPS device. Bring sufficient water and food, a first aid kit, and emergency gear. Be prepared for cold conditions even in summer; in winter, avalanches and ice significantly increase risk and require alpine experience.",
