    "summary": "Grafton Way is a demanding long-distance hike in the UK, covering approximately 89.1 km. The route demands solid navigation, steady legs, and careful planning to manage variable terrain and weather across a multi-day trek.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of grassy moorland, gravel tracks, forest paths, hedgerows, and occasional river crossings. Footing can be uneven and rocky in places, with exposed sections on higher ground. Navigation is important in areas with limited signage, and weather can change quickly in the UK.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for variable weather and short daylight hours. Carry a detailed map and reliable navigation tool (map and compass or GPS). Tell someone your itinerary and expected finish times. Stay on public rights of way, pack sufficient water and food, and have a means to signal for help (whistle, mobile signal where available). Have a first aid kit, emergency shelter, and appropriate layers for warmth and rain. Let someone know if you need to shorten or cancel the route due to conditions.",
