    "summary": "The Goathland to Grosmont Rail Trail is a 20.4 km hike along the historic North Yorkshire Moors Railway bed between Goathland and Grosmont in the UK. Labeled as hard, the route combines long distance with varied terrain and potential exposed moorland sections, demanding good fitness and careful footing.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily follows a former railway bed with surfaces of compacted gravel and occasional ballast patches. The trail is mostly flat to gently undulating, interspersed with short climbs. Expect uneven, muddy spots after rain and exposed winds on moorland sections. Gates, stiles, and farm tracks may appear; weather can change quickly, so be prepared for a range of conditions.",
