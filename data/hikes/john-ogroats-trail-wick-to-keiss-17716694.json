    "summary": "A demanding 31 km coastal hike along the Wick to Keiss section of the John O'Groats Trail in northern Scotland. The route follows rugged cliff paths, remote shoreline and exposed moorland, requiring good navigation, solid footwear and endurance.",
    "terrain_summary": "Rugged coastal terrain with rocky cliff tops, uneven paths, boggy or grassy sections and occasional beach crossings. Footing can be loose, wet or eroded; expect exposed sections with strong winds and limited protection from the elements.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a remote coastal route with few services and limited mobile reception. Start early to ensure daylight and know the tide and weather forecasts. Carry navigation tools (map, compass, and GPS), a fully charged phone, sufficient water and food, a first aid kit, and emergency waterproof layer. Wear sturdy boots, stay aware of weather changes, and be prepared for long stretches with no shelter. Inform someone of your plans and consider a personal locator beacon for added safety.",
