    "summary": "A challenging 21-km day hike in the UK, intertwining industrial heritage with rugged countryside near Consett. Expect steep ascents, rough terrain, and exposed sections that test fitness and nav skills.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mix of compact country paths, woodland trails, exposed moorland, rocky ascents, and sections near former industrial sites. Surface can be uneven with gradients and occasional boggy patches after rain. Navigation can be tricky in open countryside; weather can shift quickly.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard 21-km route with steep sections and uneven ground. Check the forecast and be prepared for sudden changes in weather; wear layers and carry waterproofs. Bring a map and compass; a GPS device is useful but don’t rely on it alone. Start early to ensure daylight and tell someone your planned route and return time. Wear sturdy boots, carry a first aid kit, whistle, and emergency layer. Be aware of exposed winds on higher ground and stay on marked paths; watch for livestock. In an emergency, dial 999 or 112. Carry water and snacks to maintain energy.",
