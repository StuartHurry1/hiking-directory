    "summary": "The Ceredigion Coast Path is a challenging long-distance coastal hike in the UK, spanning about 424.6 km along the Welsh coast. It combines rugged cliff sections, sandy beaches, tidal estuaries, and sweeping sea views, demanding good fitness, navigation, and thorough preparation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of cliff-top trails, intertidal paths, beaches, coves, grassy headlands, and occasional forest tracks. Some sections are exposed to wind and rain, with muddy or uneven footing after wet weather. Navigation can be straightforward in populated stretches but remote segments may require map skills and a plan for gaps between services.",
    "safety_notes": "Coastal weather can be highly changeable; tides and sea conditions can affect route segments. The hike passes through remote areas with limited services and variable cell reception, so plan for long stretches between towns. Prepare for steep ascents and descents, slippery surfaces, and variable trail quality. Always carry a map/compass or GPS, inform someone of your itinerary, check tide tables, and have an emergency plan and suitable emergency gear.",
