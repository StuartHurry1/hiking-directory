Wear sturdy boots and waterproofs, carry a map and compass (and a fully charged phone as a backup), and tell someone your plan. Start early to ensure daylight, stay on established paths where possible, and be cautious on wet, boggy ground and exposed ridges. The route is strenuous and not recommended for beginners.",
