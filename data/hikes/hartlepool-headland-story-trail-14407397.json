    "summary": "Hartlepool Headland Story Trail is a 7.6 km moderate coastal walk along the Hartlepool Headland in the northeast of England. The route runs along clifftop paths, promenade sections and quieter inland tracks, punctuated by story panels that bring local history to life, with sea views throughout.",

Bring layers, a waterproof jacket, and sun protection. Carry water and a small first-aid kit; ensure your phone is charged in case of emergencies. Mobile reception can be patchy in some parts of the headland.",
