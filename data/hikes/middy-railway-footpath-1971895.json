    "summary": "A demanding long-distance trek along the Middy Railway Footpath in the United Kingdom. The route covers 36.4 km and carries a hard difficulty rating due to the distance and potential weather conditions. Suitable for experienced hikers with solid fitness and navigation skills.",
    "terrain_summary": "The path follows a disused railway corridor. Expect mostly firm surfaces such as compacted gravel and ballast, with occasional grassy edges and uneven sections. Long, straight stretches can be exposed to wind; after rain surfaces may be muddy and slippery; some sections may involve gentle embankments, gates, or small bridges.",
    "safety_notes": "- Plan for a long day and start early to ensure daylight. - Check the weather and be prepared for rain; surfaces can become slippery. - Carry a detailed map and compass or GPS, and download offline maps; stay on the official path. - Mobile reception may be limited in remote sections; inform someone of your route and expected return. - Wear sturdy, ankle-supporting boots; bring extra layers and waterproof clothing. - Bring sufficient water (2–3 L) and high-energy snacks; have a light meal for energy. - Pack a small first-aid kit, blister care items, sunscreen, and a hat. - Carry a headtorch with spare batteries and a whistle for emergencies. - Consider an emergency shelter or space blanket in case of delays; have a plan for seeking shelter. - Be mindful of rights of way and respect other path users; watch for livestock or gates. - In winter, expect cold winds and icy sections; adjust plans accordingly.",
