    "summary": "Beeches Way is a demanding long-distance hike in the UK, spanning 42.8 km. It is best left to experienced hikers due to sustained effort, variable terrain, and potentially exposed sections. A planned itinerary, solid navigation, and proper gear are essential.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route covers mixed terrain: forest tracks, uneven footpaths, mud, and occasional open moorland or heath. Expect tree roots, rocky sections, variable footing, and weather-driven conditions. Navigation may rely on map and compass as markers can be limited in places.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a strenuous full-day or multi-day trek. Check weather forecasts; UK conditions can change rapidly. Carry a map and compass (GPS as backup), fully charged phone, whistle, and a first-aid kit. Bring enough water (2–3 L) and high-energy food; dress in layers with a waterproof shell and extra insulation. Wear sturdy boots; consider trekking poles. Start early to ensure daylight; inform someone of your plan; practice Leave No Trace. In winter, daylight is short and conditions can be hazardous.",
