    "summary": "Bittern Line Walk 9 is a strenuous 23.9 km hike in the UK following the Bittern Line corridor. The route rewards with varied rural scenery but demands solid stamina, reliable navigation, and careful planning. Expect long stretches along hedged farmland, short woodland sections, and occasional road or railway crossings. The total distance and exposure make it best suited to experienced hikers who start early and carry appropriate gear.",
    "terrain_summary": "The terrain combines gravel and dirt tracks, grassy fields, mud in wetter seasons, hedgerows, and intermittent woodland paths, with occasional rural roads. Footing can be uneven and there are stiles and gates to negotiate. Open stretches provide wind exposure and shade is sporadic.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan around the weather and daylight; carry a map, compass or GPS, and a charged phone with offline maps. Stay on marked paths and use designated crossings at rail lines; do not cross active tracks. Wear sturdy boots and be prepared for mud and uneven surfaces. Watch for livestock and gates; close gates behind you. Carry enough water and snacks for the distance, and let someone know your route and expected return time. In poor visibility or severe weather, consider postponing.",
