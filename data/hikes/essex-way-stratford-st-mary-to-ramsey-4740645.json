    "summary": "A 48.2 km long, hard section of the Essex Way, running from Stratford St Mary to Ramsey in the UK. The route traverses broad Essex countryside—quiet lanes, farmland, river valleys, and small villages—making for a demanding long-distance hike that may be completed in one very long day or split across multiple days with overnight stops. It rewards persistent walkers with pastoral scenery, wildlife and a sense of rural solitude.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of surfaces: well-defined footpaths, field margins, occasional woodland tracks, and rural roads. The terrain is mostly flat to gently rolling, but the cumulative distance makes it strenuous. Be prepared for mud after rain, stiles and gates, and navigational attention in open paddocks or farm tracks. Scenic highlights may include riverbank sections and views across the surrounding countryside near Stratford St Mary.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in the UK can change quickly; check forecasts before setting out. The hike is long and physically demanding—plan for rests, water, and nutrition. Navigation is generally straightforward on waymarked routes, but carry a map and compass as a backup (GPS optional). Footing can be uneven and muddy; wear sturdy waterproof boots. Be mindful of livestock, gates and stile crossings; close gates behind you. Carry a light source if walking near dusk and have a plan for shelter or accommodation if weather turns bad. Inform someone of your itinerary, carry a charged mobile phone, but do not rely on signal in all areas. Respect private land and practice Leave No Trace.",
