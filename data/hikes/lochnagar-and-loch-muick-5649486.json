    "summary": "An ambitious 33.2 km circuit in Scotland that links Lochnagar with Loch Muick. The hike traverses rugged ridgelines, lochside paths, and moorland, offering remote scenery and a true challenge for experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rocky mountain paths, exposed ridges, peat bogs, heather moorland, and occasional stream crossings. The route includes steep ascents, long descents, and damp, uneven surfaces common in Scottish uplands. Navigation and weather can be decisive factors; daylight and visibility vary by season.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard, long day on varied and sometimes technical terrain. Weather in the Highlands can change rapidly; check forecasts and be prepared for wind, rain, and cold even in summer. Navigation skills are essential; carry a map and compass (GPS is helpful but not reliable). Start early to ensure daylight; tell someone your plan. Bring sufficient water and high energy food; peat bogs and wet sections can be draining. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and consider trekking poles for stability. Some sections pass through private Balmoral Estate land—check access permissions and parking arrangements before you go. If conditions are poor or you are uncertain, turn back.",
