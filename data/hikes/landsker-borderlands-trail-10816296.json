    "summary": "The Landsker Borderlands Trail is a hard, long-distance route in the United Kingdom, spanning about 289.8 km. It follows historic borderlands, weaving through farmland, woodlands, uplands, and coastal segments. The route demands substantial fitness, navigation skills, and thorough preparation for variable UK weather and remote sections.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied mix of terrain: gentle country lanes, hedgerow climbs, open uplands with long grassy slopes, woodland tracks, moorland stretches, and occasional coastal paths. Elevation gains can be substantial with long ascents and descents, uneven footing, gates and stiles, and potential mud after rain. Weather can change quickly, so be prepared for wind, rain, sun and sea spray on exposed sections.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a multi-day trek with adequate daylight and rest days where needed. Carry a detailed map and compass or GPS, and know how to use them. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and pack layers for temperature changes. Check local conditions and tide times for coastal sections; be mindful of weather, floods, and remote stretches with limited services. Tell someone your route and expected finish times; carry a charged phone with offline maps as coverage may be poor. Hydration and food are essential; carry extra water on longer stretches and know the locations of possible resupply points. Wildlife, remote roads, and uneven terrain can pose risks; take care near cliff edges and livestock, and respect private property.",
