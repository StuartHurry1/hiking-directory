    "summary": "A challenging 61.2 km hike around the Cuilcagh area in the UK, typically undertaken as a multi-day trek. The route features varied terrain—from forest trails to upland moor, rocky ridges, and limestone pavements—requiring good fitness, solid navigation, and weather readiness.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of woodland paths, open moorland, boggy sections, rocky steps, limestone pavements, and occasional boardwalks. Terrain can be uneven and wet; you may encounter gates, stiles, water crossings, and exposed ridgelines.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a multi-day trek (route length suggests 2–4 days depending on pace). Weather in this region can change rapidly, bringing wind, rain, and cold conditions even in summer. Stay on waymarked paths where possible and carry a detailed map and compass as primary navigation tools (GPS as backup). Start early to maximize daylight and share your itinerary with someone. Prepare for boggy ground and mud, wear waterproof boots and layered clothing, and bring a first aid kit, emergency gear, and sufficient food and water. Have a means of communication and consider satellite messaging in remote sections. Respect private land boundaries and local access rules.",
