    "summary": "The Loch Kinord Trail is a 6.4 km moderate circuit around Loch Kinord in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The route runs along lochside paths, woodland tracks and open grassy banks, with occasional gentle rises and viewpoints over the water. It suits walkers with a reasonable fitness level and includes some uneven sections.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly well-formed paths along the loch and through woodland, including boardwalk sections by the water. Expect a mix of gravel tracks, wooden boardwalks, and short grassy or rocky segments; the trail has gentle rolling terrain with a few short ascents and descents.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the weather forecast before you go, as Scottish conditions can change quickly. Wear sturdy walking boots and carry a waterproof layer. Stay on marked paths, keep dogs under control, and bring a map or GPS and a charged phone. Bring water and snacks, and be mindful of insects in warmer months. In winter, daylight hours are shorter and conditions can be more challenging—plan accordingly.",
