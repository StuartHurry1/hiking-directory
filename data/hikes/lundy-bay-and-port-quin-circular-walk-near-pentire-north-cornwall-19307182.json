    "summary": "This 9.1 km circular coastal walk links Lundy Bay with Port Quin via Pentire Head, delivering dramatic sea views, sea cliffs, and rugged headland scenery near North Cornwall. The route is moderately challenging with uneven surfaces and gentle ascents, suitable for walkers with some coastal hiking experience.",
    "terrain_summary": "The terrain is a mix of grassy paths, cliff-top tracks, and rocky sections. Expect uneven surfaces, narrow ledges, and occasional steps or gates. Sections along the coast can be exposed to wind and spray, and there may be mud after rain. Tide times can affect parts of the route near Port Quin, so plan accordingly.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times and weather before setting out, especially around Port Quin. Stay on marked paths and away from cliff edges, as some sections are exposed and can be slippery. Wear sturdy boots, bring waterproof gear, and carry enough water and snacks. Dogs should be kept under control; keep children close on cliff areas. Have a mapped route or GPS and a charged phone for emergencies.",
