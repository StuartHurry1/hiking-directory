    "summary": "The Fen Rivers Way from Ely to King's Lynn is a 62.7 km long-distance hike across the Norfolk and Cambridgeshire Fens. The route follows rivers and fenland lanes from Ely, weaving through flat, open farmland, wet meadows and reed beds, with occasional boardwalks and village stretches. It is considered hard because of the distance, long exposed stretches, muddy or flooded sections after rain, and the need to navigate across featureless fenland with limited services.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily flat fenland terrain with long stretches of open track, riverbanks, and reed beds. Expect muddy fields, soft tracks after rain, occasional boardwalks, dikes, and water crossings. Some sections run along quiet country lanes with few amenities and variable signage; wind can be strong on exposed stretches near water.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multi-day trekking with reliable navigation because services are sparse. Check weather and moisture conditions; wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring waterproof clothing. Carry a map, compass or GPS, a charged phone and portable charger. Pack enough water and energy, plus a basic first aid kit. Be prepared for mud, floods, and necessary detours; inform someone of your route; watch for livestock and farm traffic on rural lanes; daylight hours vary by season.",
