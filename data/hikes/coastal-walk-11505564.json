    "summary": "Coastal Walk is an 8.7 km moderate coastal hike in the UK, offering sea views, varied shore terrain, and opportunities to spot wildlife. The route showcases a mix of grassy cliffs, rocky sections, and boardwalks, with changing weather and sea spray creating a dynamic coastal experience.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect exposed coastal paths with a mix of grassy clifftops, rocky footing, mud in damp weather, and occasional stairs or boardwalk sections. Some areas near the shoreline can be slippery when wet and windswept; maintain caution near cliff edges and stay on marked paths.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times and coastal conditions before starting; parts of the route may be affected by high tide. Wear sturdy, grippy footwear and bring a waterproof/windproof layer. Be prepared for sudden weather changes, strong winds, and sea spray. Keep a safe distance from cliff edges, follow waymarkers, and carry a map or offline navigation. Let someone know your plan and expected return time. Carry water, snacks, a basic first aid kit, sun protection in sunny conditions, and a phone charged for emergencies (dial 999 in the UK if needed).",
