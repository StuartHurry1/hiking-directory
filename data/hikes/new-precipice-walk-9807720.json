    "summary": "New Precipice Walk is a demanding 18.7 km hiking route in the United Kingdom (region unspecified) that combines exposed cliff-top paths with rugged, uneven terrain. The route requires solid fitness, good navigation, and careful planning due to variable UK weather and potential scrambling sections.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect rocky footpaths, steep ascents and descents, uneven ground, and exposed ledges along cliff edges. Muddy sections are common in wet weather. Some parts may involve careful footing and occasional light scrambling. Weather can change rapidly, so be prepared for strong winds and rain.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard hike with exposure. Check the forecast and daylight hours before setting out. Carry navigation tools, map and compass (or GPS), and a fully charged phone. Stay on marked paths, maintain a safe distance from cliff edges, and watch for loose rocks. Do not hike alone; tell someone your route and estimated return time. Bring a whistle, first-aid kit, and suitable clothing for sudden weather changes. If conditions worsen (strong winds, rain, darkness, or fatigue), turn back. If coastal sections apply, be mindful of tides and slippery rocks.",
