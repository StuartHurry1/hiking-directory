    "summary": "A challenging 62.9 km long-distance trail in the UK, following the Finchale Camino Inglés variant from Durham to Escomb. The route blends rural lanes, fields, and woodlands with occasional road sections, and tests experienced hikers with long days and variable weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Varied terrain including country lanes, hedged footpaths, farmland, and woodland tracks. Expect mud after rain, stile crossings, gradual elevation gains, and several short road sections. The overall distance favors endurance and steady pacing.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multiple hiking days to complete 62.9 km. UK weather is unpredictable—bring waterproofs and warm layers, even in summer. Wear sturdy, waterproof boots with good grip. Carry navigation aids (map and compass or GPS) and know how to use them. Stay hydrated and carry enough food; have extra water sources if possible, but do not rely on them. Inform someone of your itinerary and check daylight hours; carry a charged phone and portable charger. Be mindful of limited mobile coverage in rural areas and walk safely on road sections; wear high-visibility gear at dusk. Expect mud, uneven ground, and fence crossings; take it easy on technical parts. Carry a small first-aid kit, whistle, and emergency blanket as a precaution. Respect farmland and private property and follow local access rules.",
