    "summary": "Maelor Way is a challenging 97-kilometre long-distance trail in the UK, designed for experienced hikers. It traverses varied countryside with rolling hills, farmland, and intermittent tracks. The route requires solid navigation, good fitness, and careful multi-day planning to manage daily distances and potential weather changes.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain ranges from quiet rural lanes and grassy bridleways to boggy fields and uneven, rocky sections. Expect stile crossings, gates, and mud after rain, with exposed viewpoints along elevated stretches. Elevation gains are steady, adding up to a strenuous overall effort despite non-technical ground.",
    "safety_notes": "Check weather forecasts and be prepared for changes. Carry a detailed map and compass; mobile signal can be unreliable in rural areas. Start early to maximize daylight and avoid navigation pressure. Inform someone of your plan and daily milestones. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring extra layers, water, and snacks. Be mindful of livestock, gate etiquette, and potential seasonal closures. In poor visibility or severe weather, reassess whether to complete the route in a single day.",
