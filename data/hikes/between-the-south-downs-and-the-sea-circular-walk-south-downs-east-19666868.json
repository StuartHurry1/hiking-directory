    "summary": "A challenging 17.2 km circular hike along the South Downs East, blending chalk downs, coastal scenery, and rural lanes. The route offers sweeping sea views, rugged upland sections, and exposure to wind; best suited for experienced hikers prepared for long distances and varied terrain. Expect steep ascents and uneven surfaces as you traverse the downs and coast before returning to the start point.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily chalk downland paths with steep ascents and descents, mixed with grassy tracks, some flint/stone sections, and occasional woodland and meadow crossing. Expect uneven ground, muddy stretches after rain, short sections of steps or stiles, and exposed ridgelines near the coast with potential strong winds and sea spray. Take care near cliff edges and follow official paths.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times and weather forecast before you start; avoid cliff-edge sections during high winds or poor visibility. Stay on established paths, carry a map and compass or GPS, and know your route. Allow extra time for longer stretches and potential detours. Bring sufficient water, snacks, sun protection in sunny weather, and layers for changing conditions. In an emergency, contact local authorities (999 in the UK).",
