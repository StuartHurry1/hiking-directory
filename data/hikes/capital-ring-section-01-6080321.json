    "summary": "Capital Ring (Section 01) is the first leg of a long-distance circular walk in the UK, covering 24.8 km. This hard section blends urban paths, parkland, and canal towpaths, with occasional gentle gradients. It is best tackled by experienced hikers with good navigation skills and stamina.",
    "terrain_summary": "A mixed surface route: sections along city streets and pavements, park trails, canal towpaths, and some grassy or compact earth paths. Expect frequent urban crossings, potential crowding, and occasional muddy patches after rain. Elevation is generally gentle but the overall distance and exposure to urban hazards require steady footing and attention to wayfinding.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long and challenging section with city traffic, canal edges, and variable surfaces. Stay alert for pedestrians, cyclists, and road junctions. Plan for daylight hours, carry a charged phone and map, and have a navigation backup. Weather can change quickly; prepare for wind, rain, and mud. Let someone know your plans and estimated finish time.",
