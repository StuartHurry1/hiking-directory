    "summary": "GM Ringway Stage 17 is a 27.9 km hard hike in the UK, part of the GM Ringway route. This stage combines long ascents, exposed sections and mixed terrain, demanding solid fitness, navigation and preparation.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route uses a mix of tarmac, gravel tracks, woodland paths, wet meadow crossings and rocky sections. Expect long ascents, potential boggy patches and occasional open moorland with wind exposure. Stiles and gates may add brief delays; footing can be uneven, with mud after rain. Weather in the UK can change quickly, especially on higher ground, so protection against wind and rain is essential.",

Tell someone your planned route and expected finish time. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers. Bring ample water and nutrition, a basic first aid kit, and emergency gear (light, space blanket). Be prepared for muddy or slippery sections, and turn back if weather or footing becomes unsafe.",
