    "summary": "A demanding 59.7 km long-distance hike in the UK following a scenic river corridor. The Cray Riverway is best attempted by experienced trekkers, either as a multi-day route or a long, strenuous single day. Expect varied terrain, riverbank paths, ascents, and stretches of mud or uneven footing. Careful planning for weather, daylight, and navigation is essential.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain varies from grassy riverbanks and woodland trails to muddy tracks and rocky sections. Expect uneven footing, stiles, occasional boardwalks, and boggy patches after rain. Some sections may be poorly signposted; a map and compass or GPS is recommended.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long or multi-day trek: ensure training, hydration, and regular breaks. UK weather can change quickly; waterproof layers and warm clothing are essential. Riverbank sections can be slippery and cold; wear sturdy boots with good grip and ankle support. Navigation can be challenging where signs are sparse; carry a map and compass or GPS and know how to use them. Start early to maximize daylight, especially in autumn and winter, and inform someone of your itinerary. In an emergency, call 999 (or 112) and provide your location. Pack a compact first aid kit, blister care, a whistle, and emergency shelter. Practice Leave No Trace and respect wildlife and other users.",
