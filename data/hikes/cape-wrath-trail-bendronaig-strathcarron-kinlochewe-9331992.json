    "summary": "A rugged, remote long-distance hike along a 65.2 km segment of the Cape Wrath Trail in northwest Scotland, from Bendronaig to Kinlochewe via Strathcarron. This hard route traverses open moorland, peat bogs, and exposed ridges, with significant elevation changes and limited day-length. It’s best suited for experienced hikers seeking wild scenery and solitude.",
    "terrain_summary": "Remote Highland terrain with a mix of peat bogs, heather moorland, rocky ridges, scree, river crossings, and forest tracks. Expect long stretches without shelter, occasional fences, and variable footing across upland moor and coastal-influenced terrain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for remote travel with limited resupply and phone coverage. Check weather conditions as coastal and highland weather can change rapidly. Navigation should rely on map and compass (GPS as backup). Start early to maximize daylight; carry emergency shelter and a means to call for help in an emergency. Inform someone of your route and expected completion. Be prepared for river crossings and potential boggy sections; have sturdy footwear and adequate waterproofing. Hydration and food planning are essential for multi-day segments; know your turnaround points if weather closes in.",
