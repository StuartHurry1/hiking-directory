    "summary": "The Faringdon Walk, Coleshill is a challenging 27.8 km hike through rural Oxfordshire countryside, starting near Faringdon and looping toward Coleshill. The route offers rolling farmland, hedgerows, and occasional woodlands with long, exposed stretches and several gentle climbs. It's a strenuous day out that suits fit walkers with comfort navigating rural paths and gates.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of grassy field edges, gravel tracks, minor lanes, and occasional woodland. The hike features undulating terrain with several ascents and descents, stiles and gates, occasional muddy patches after rain, and some short road sections. Navigation is straightforward on well-marked paths but can be lost in leafy overgrowth in woodland sections.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, strenuous hike in rural countryside. Check local weather and daylight hours; hedgerows can obscure views in fog. Wear sturdy boots, bring waterproof layers, and carry sufficient water and snacks. Use a map and compass or GPS; keep mobile battery charged. Watch for livestock, farm vehicles on minor lanes, and crossing stiles. Tell someone your planned route and expected finish time. Leave no trace and stay on designated paths.",
