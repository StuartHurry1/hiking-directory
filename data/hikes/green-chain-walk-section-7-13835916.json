    "summary": "Green Chain Walk Section 7 is a 14.8 km moderate hike in the United Kingdom along a segment of the Green Chain long distance route. The terrain typically blends urban green spaces, parkland, woodland and riverside paths, with gentle climbs and occasional boardwalks. It suits walkers with moderate fitness and can be completed in a full day or split into shorter sections depending on pace and daylight.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain ranges from paved or compact gravel towpaths and park paths to woodland trails. Some sections may be muddy after rain and there can be short steep ascents, stairs or uneven ground. Expect a few road crossings and signs typical of urban trails, with occasional distant views of rivers or cityscapes depending on the exact section.",
    "safety_notes": "Check weather, daylight hours and any area closures before setting out. Stay on public paths and respect private property and landowners. Wear sturdy footwear and bring a waterproof layer, hat and sun protection as appropriate. Carry enough water and snacks, a map or GPS, a charged phone and a small first aid kit. Be mindful of traffic at road crossings and urban interfaces, and carry a light if finishing near dusk. If the route is new, plan an exit option or shorter mileage in case conditions are difficult.",
