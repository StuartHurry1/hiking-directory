    "summary": "A challenging 21.7 km route in the UK that links three historic castles through varied countryside. The hike combines long distances, steep climbs, and rewarding views, designed for experienced walkers with solid navigation skills.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rural lanes, field paths, and bridleways with uneven surfaces. Sections may be muddy or boggy after rain, and there are several steep ascents and long, open stretches. You’ll encounter hedgerows, gates, and occasional stiles, with variable visibility in rural areas.",
    "safety_notes": "Prepare for a full-day hike on varied terrain with exposed sections. Wear sturdy boots and bring weather-appropriate clothing. Navigation can be challenging in remote stretches; carry a map, compass or GPS, and know your route. Respect private land and livestock when crossing farmland. Pack sufficient water and high-energy snacks, and have a means to signal for help (phone with coverage, whistle). Let someone know your itinerary and expected finish time. In adverse weather or poor daylight, consider postponing or shortening the route.",
