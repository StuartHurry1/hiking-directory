    "summary": "Cringleford's River Crossings Trail is a demanding 15.6 km hike in the UK that follows a river with multiple crossings, offering varied terrain and a true endurance challenge.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines grassy riverbanks, woodland footpaths, and muddy, uneven trails. Expect several river crossings (fordable in dry conditions), occasional rocky steps, exposed roots, and long sections of soft ground. Elevation gains are steady but persistent, requiring good footing and concentration.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard hike with multiple river crossings. Check weather and river levels before setting out; crossings can be slippery and unpredictable after rain. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layered, moisture-wicking clothing. Carry a map or GPS, a charged phone, and a small first aid kit. Inform someone of your plan, start early, and turn back if water levels rise or weather deteriorates.",
