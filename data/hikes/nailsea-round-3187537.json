    "summary": "Nailsea Round is a challenging 34.9 km circular hike around Nailsea in the Somerset countryside. The route blends rural lanes, hedgerow footpaths, fields, and occasional road sections, with several gentle climbs and two longer ascents. It rewards with varied scenery from farmland and woodlands to open countryside and distant views on clear days.",
    "terrain_summary": "Varied terrain including surfaced lanes, grassy and gravel paths, muddy fields after rain, and some rocky or compact earth sections. Expect stiles, gates, and occasional road crossings. Navigation is straightforward on the well-marked loop, but weather can make hedgerows overgrown and paths slippery.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for changeable UK weather. Daylight hours vary by season; carry a map or GPS and a charged phone. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and, for rain or cold, pack waterproofs and extra layers. Bring enough water and food for a long day (2–3 litres and snacks). Inform someone of your route and expected finish time. Watch for traffic on road sections, livestock in fields, and muddy or uneven ground, especially after rain. In exposed or windy conditions, protect against wind chill.",
