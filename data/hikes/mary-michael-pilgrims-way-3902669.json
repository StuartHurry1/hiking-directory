    "summary": "The Mary Michael Pilgrims Way is a demanding long-distance trek in the United Kingdom, covering about 480.9 km. It is suited for experienced hikers who can manage significant daily distances, varied terrain, and exposure to changeable weather. Proper planning, fitness, and reliable gear are essential to complete the route at a steady pace.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied mix of rural landscapes across the UK: rolling farmland and hedgerows, woodlands and country lanes, occasional moorland, and upland sections with exposed ridgelines. Surface conditions can be muddy after rain, with uneven tracks and occasional scrambling in rougher stretches. Navigation relies on waymarks and route notes in places, so preparation is important.",

Plan for multiple days, carry navigation tools (maps or a GPS), and inform someone of your itinerary. Wear sturdy waterproof boots, bring layered clothing, and have a reliable rain shell. Stay hydrated, manage energy with regular food intake, watch for fatigue, and be prepared for sudden weather changes, limited cell reception, and river or bog crossings. Practice Leave No Trace and have a way to call for help in an emergency.",
