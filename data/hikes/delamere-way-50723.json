    "summary": "Delamere Way is a challenging long-distance hike in the UK, roughly 66.1 km in length, weaving through lakes and forested terrain. The route is best suited to experienced walkers who can handle long days, mixed surfaces, and variable weather. The region is not specified, but the hike runs in the UK and emphasizes lakes as a recurring theme.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail uses a mix of woodland tracks, grassy paths, and damp or muddy sections. Expect some exposed lakebank sections and minor ascents/descents; footing can be uneven with roots and stones. Navigation skills are useful in gaps where signs are sparse.",

Check the weather forecast and daylight hours; UK weather can change quickly. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and layering; stay hydrated and carry snacks. Pack lightweight rain gear and a small first-aid kit; tell someone your route and expected finish time; avoid single points of failure and be mindful of rural wildlife and farmed land access rules.",
