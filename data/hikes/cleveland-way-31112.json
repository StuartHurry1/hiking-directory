    "summary": "The Cleveland Way is a challenging long-distance hike in the UK, covering 114.6 km of varied terrain. It’s best suited to experienced trekkers who can manage multi-day treks, navigation on exposed sections, and significant elevation gains through moorland, ridges, forests, and coastal paths.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied landscape: exposed moorland and ridges with strong winds, rocky ascents and descents, forest tracks, and occasional coastal cliff sections. The route includes boggy moorland in places and long, uninterrupted segments where weather can change rapidly.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan as a multi-day trek (roughly 4–6 days at a steady pace). Weather in the UK changes quickly; carry layers, waterproofs, and wind protection. Navigation: bring a map and compass; don’t rely solely on GPS. Be prepared for exposed cliff and moorland sections; stay away from cliff edges in poor visibility. Moorland can be boggy; wear sturdy boots and consider gaiters. Some sections are remote with limited phone signal—tell someone your itinerary and expected finish times; carry a means of emergency shelter and a whistle. Stay aware of livestock on rural paths; check for ticks and protect against them; carry water purification if you plan to source water from streams. Tide times and coastal conditions should be checked where applicable.",
