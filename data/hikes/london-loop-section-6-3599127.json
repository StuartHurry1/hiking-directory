    "summary": "London LOOP Section 6 covers a 16.8 km stretch of the circular London LOOP trail in the UK. Classified as hard, the route combines both rural paths and occasional urban sections, with longer distances between checkpoints and notable elevation changes that test stamina and navigation skills. It is best undertaken by experienced hikers prepared for a strenuous day on foot.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain varies from gravel tracks and grassy fields to leafy woodland trails and short road sections. Expect uneven footing, exposed stretches, and sections that can be muddy after rain. Elevation changes are progressive rather than steep peaks, with a mix of gentle climbs and longer descents.",
