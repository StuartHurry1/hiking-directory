    "summary": "Daffodil Way is a 22.6 km hard hike in the UK that threads through varied countryside. The route combines country lanes, grassy fields, muddy tracks, and occasional steep sections, with gates and stiles to negotiate. It rewards persistent walkers with open views and seasonal blooms when flowers are in season. This is a demanding trek that requires solid navigation and preparation for changing weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain is mixed: smooth gravel tracks, narrow paths across fields, muddy sections after rain, and short steep ascents and descents. Expect uneven footing, occasional wet grass, and several cattle grids or stiles. The distance makes fatigue a factor, so pace yourself and plan for breaks.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for variable UK weather; bring waterproofs and extra layers; wear sturdy boots; carry map and compass or GPS; keep to rights of way; watch for livestock and gate swings; start with a full water bottle; let someone know your route and expected return time; if visibility is low or a storm is forecast, consider postponing.",
