    "summary": "Astwith Walk is a demanding 17.6 km circuit in the UK that tests fitness with long distances, elevation changes and rugged terrain. The route combines exposure to the elements with technical footing, offering a day-long hike that rewards perseverance and steady navigation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect rough tracks, rocky outcrops, grass moorland and occasional boggy patches.

Stay on marked paths where possible, watch for boggy ground and drops, and carry enough water and food. Tell someone your planned route and expected return; mobile signal may be limited in remote areas. If visibility is poor, consider turning back.",
