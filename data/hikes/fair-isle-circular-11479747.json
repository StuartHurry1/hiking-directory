    "summary": "The Fair Isle Circular is a 14.2 km loop in the UK of moderate difficulty. It blends coastal paths with grassy and rocky sections, rewarding hikers with sea views, wildlife opportunities, and a satisfying day out. Expect varied terrain, some elevation, and potentially strong winds; plan for a full day and good navigation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain varies from coastal footpaths and grassy leads to short rocky climbs. Expect uneven footing, muddy patches after rain, and exposed sections with open Atlantic views. Weather can shift quickly; protective footwear and layers are essential.",
    "safety_notes": "Always check the forecast and tide times if the route runs near the shoreline. Stay on marked paths, keep a safe distance from cliff edges, and avoid loose rocks. Carry a map and compass (or a GPS), and know how to use them. Tell someone your plan and ETA. Bring enough water and food, light rain protection, and extra layers; in UK conditions, carry a means to call for help and use 999 in emergencies.",
