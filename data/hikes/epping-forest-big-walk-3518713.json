    "summary": "The Epping Forest Big Walk is a demanding long-distance hike in the UK, covering 63.5 km. It can be completed in a long day or split into two sessions, and traverses a mix of forest paths, gravel tracks, and occasional road crossings around the Epping area.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily forest and footpath terrain with some gentle elevation changes. Expect rooty, muddy sections after rain, exposed gravel paths, and occasional road crossings. The route combines shaded trails with open edges, so conditions can vary with weather.",
    "safety_notes": "Because the route is 63.5 km, plan for a very long day or multiple days. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours; wear suitable footwear and moisture-wicking layers. Carry a map and compass or GPS, plus a charged phone as a backup. Bring sufficient water and food, plus a small first aid kit, identification, and a whistle. Inform someone of your route and expected finish time. Be mindful of road crossings and traffic; in poor visibility, use reflective clothing and lights if starting early or finishing late. If fatigue sets in, consider turning back or splitting the hike into two sessions.",
