    "summary": "Alban Way is a 24.3 km hike in the UK that blends urban pathways with green corridors. The route is long and physically demanding, with minimal technical difficulty but a substantial distance that can take most walkers a full day. Expect varied surfaces and occasional road crossings; solid navigation and steady pacing are essential.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily paved or compacted surfaces suitable for walking and cycling, with occasional gravel stretches and a few roadside verges.
