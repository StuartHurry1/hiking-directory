    "summary": "A challenging 22.1 km hike through Maidenhead's greenspaces, combining woodland, meadow trails, and riverside sections. The Maidenhead Commons Trail is long and physically demanding (hard), with varied surfaces and several gentle ascents. Suitable for experienced hikers with good footwear, navigation, and planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain is mixed: compact gravel and well-trodden paths, grassy meadows, and muddy woodland tracks. Expect uneven ground, exposed roots, and a few short steep sections. There are stile crossings and gates, plus occasional boardwalks near the river. Footing can be slippery after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for daylight hours; the distance makes this a full-day hike for many. Carry a map or offline GPS, a charged phone, and tell someone your plan and expected return. Stay aware of road crossings near the start and finish, and be cautious on riverbank sections after rain. Bring water, snacks, sun protection in fine weather, and a windproof layer. In an emergency, dial 999 in the UK (112 is also available).",
