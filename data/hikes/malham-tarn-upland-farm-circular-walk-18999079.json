    "terrain_summary": "Mixed surfaces including grassy farm tracks, heather moorland, and limestone pavement near the tarn. Expect uneven footing, gates and stiles, and potentially boggy, wet patches after rain. Some exposed sections and rocky steps may require careful footing.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in upland UK can change rapidly; check the forecast before you go. Wear sturdy footwear and consider gaiters for boggy sections. Stay on marked paths; gates may lead to livestock and private land. Some sections are exposed, so carry extra layers and protection against wind and rain. Carry a map or compass (or GPS), a fully charged phone, water, and snacks. Inform someone of your plan and estimated return time if hiking alone. Be cautious near the Tarn’s edge; banks can be slippery and edges uneven.",
