    "summary": "A challenging 339.4 km long-distance hike in the UK, tracing rugged Highland terrain from glens to lochs and exposed ridges. Classified as hard, it requires solid endurance, navigation skills, and several days on the trail.",

    "safety_notes": "Plan for multiple days on the trail and ensure you have strong fitness and navigation skills. Tell someone your itinerary and check weather forecasts regularly. Carry a detailed map and compass (GPS as backup), a fully charged headlamp, a first-aid kit, emergency shelter, sufficient water and food, and a means to communicate in remote areas. Be prepared for sudden weather changes, track closures, and limited rescue access in remote sections.",
