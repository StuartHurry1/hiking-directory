    "summary": "A 129.2 km hard coastal trek along the King Charles III England Coast Path from Birkenhead on the Wirral to the Welsh border. This demanding multi-day hike exposes walkers to rugged cliffs, tidal sections, and variable weather, weaving along exposed coastlines with sweeping sea views, headlands, and remote stretches.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of cliff-top pathways, exposed ridgelines, long coastal stretches, tidal beaches, mud, and varying footing. Terrain ranges from firm sea-washed tracks to rocky ascents and wooden boardwalks; some sections can be slippery and weather conditions may reduce visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long-distance, hard coastal route with rapidly changing weather. Plan days carefully and check tide tables for sections that cross beaches. Sections can be exposed with steep drops and slippery surfaces. Navigation skills are important in remote stretches where phone signal may be limited. Carry ample water and food, wear appropriate clothing, and bring a map, compass or GPS. Inform someone of your itinerary, be mindful of coastal erosion and rockfalls, and consider seasonal wind and rain when scheduling the trek.",
