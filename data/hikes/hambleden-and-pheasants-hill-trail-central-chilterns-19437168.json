The route blends rolling chalk-downland ridges with woodland trails and open fields, featuring several steep ascents and exposed viewpoints. It's suited to experienced hikers with solid navigation; plan for a full day and expect 6–8 hours depending on pace and conditions.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed terrain including chalk downland tracks, woodlands, field edges, and occasional rough or muddy sections. Look for steep climbs, uneven surfaces, and stiles and gates. In good weather, expect wide views across the Chilterns; after rain paths may be muddy and slippery.",
    "safety_notes": "Check weather and daylight hours before setting out. Wear sturdy footwear and carry a waterproof layer. The route includes steep ascents and exposed sections; navigation aids are recommended as markers can be sparse in places. Tell someone your plan and expected return time.
