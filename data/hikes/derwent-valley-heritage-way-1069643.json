    "summary": "Derwent Valley Heritage Way is a strenuous 453.2 km long-distance trail in the UK that follows historic Derwent valley routes and riverside paths. Designed for experienced hikers, it requires careful planning, steady miles, and solid navigation over multiple stages. The route traverses a mix of landscapes, from tranquil riverbanks and farmland to woodland and upland moor, with occasional road sections and heritage sites along the way.",
    "terrain_summary": "The path combines riverside towpaths, canal and country lanes, forest tracks, open moorland, and steep, uneven segments. Expect muddy surfaces after rain, rocky steps in places, and long ascents that offer wide views. The route includes both sheltered woodland sections and exposed uplands, so weather can be variable and navigation should be prepared for a few less clearly marked stretches.",
    "safety_notes": "Carry detailed maps and a reliable navigation method, as some segments are not continuously waymarked. Plan for variable UK weather, including rain and chilly conditions; pack layers and waterproofs. Break the journey into staged days with sufficient daylight; avoid long day trips in winter when daylight is short. Be prepared for road detours, livestock on farm paths, and occasional private land access restrictions. Inform someone of your itinerary and carry emergency contacts. Have a plan for food and water across long sections and know how to manage fatigue and sun exposure.",
