    "summary": "The Derby Nomad Way is a challenging long-distance hike in the UK, covering 275.5 km at a hard difficulty. The route traverses a mix of rural lanes, woodlands, and open moorland, demanding stamina, navigation, and preparedness for variable UK weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of terrain: surfaced roads and farm tracks, muddy footpaths, dense woodland, and occasional exposed moorland climbs. Elevation gains can be substantial in places, and some sections may be poorly waymarked or subject to flooding after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan the route in manageable stages and allow for rest days as needed. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours; carry a map and compass (or a reliable GPS) and know how to use them. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected return. Stay hydrated, carry enough food, and have a means to treat water. Wear sturdy boots and layered clothing; be prepared for rain, wind, and cold. Be mindful of livestock and rights of way on shared paths. If camping, follow Leave No Trace and local regulations; carry a lightweight emergency shelter. In remote sections, consider travel companions or signaling devices; know emergency numbers for the UK (999/112).",
