    "terrain_summary": "The terrain is a mix of well-trodden farmland paths, chalk tracks across downs, and woodland trails. Surfaces range from compact dirt to muddy single-track in wetter seasons; there are a few stiles and gentle gradients. Footing can be uneven underfoot in woodland sections; waterproof footwear is recommended.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for UK weather; the open downs can be exposed and windy. Wear sturdy boots, bring a waterproof layer and extra warm layer. Carry a map or GPS and know how to navigate; in parts of the route cell service may be patchy. Take sufficient water and snacks; mind gates and livestock in fields, and close gates behind you. Watch for uneven ground and steps on stiles. Shorter daylight in winter; start early or carry a torch if finishing after dusk. Tell someone your planned route and expected return.",
