    "summary": "A demanding long-distance circular trail totaling 77.2 km that links the towns of Crewe and Nantwich in the UK. This hard route traverses a mix of rural farmland, hedged lanes, and simple footpaths with varied surfaces, requiring stamina, good navigation, and careful planning. It can be tackled as a multi-day hike or strenuous single-day outing for experienced hikers who are prepared for long distances and changeable weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines tarmac country lanes, gravel tracks, grassy paths, and stony or muddy footpaths. Expect gates, stiles, hedgerows, and occasional cattle fields. Surfaces can be uneven with mud after rain; some sections are exposed to wind and weather. Navigation is important due to limited waymarking in places.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan and pre-load the route, check weather and daylight hours, and tell someone your itinerary. Carry a detailed map and compass (and a charged phone as a backup). Pack sufficient food and water (2–3 L per day) and a method to purify water. Wear sturdy waterproof boots, layered clothing, and a rain shell. Be prepared for farm crossings, livestock, and rights of way; close gates and respect crops. Split the hike into multiple days if needed; carry a lightweight emergency bivy or shelter and a whistle for signaling. In urban or busy sections, stay alert for traffic and poorly lit paths.",
    "recommended_gear": [
      "Sturdy hiking boots with good grip",
      "Waterproof jacket and pants (layered system)",
      "Warm layers and hat/gloves for cooler days",
      "Backpack (20–40 L) with rain cover",
      "Map, compass, and, if possible, a GPS device or offline maps",
      "Fully charged phone with emergency numbers saved",
      "Headtorch with extra batteries",
      "First-aid kit tailored to long hikes",
      "Food and 2–3 liters of water per day (plus water treatment option)",
      "Emergency shelter or bivy and space blanket",
      "Whistle, multitool, and spare laces",
      "Sunscreen, sunglasses, and insect repellent",
      "Trekking poles (optional but helpful on uneven terrain)"
    ],
    "best_seasons": "Spring to autumn (roughly April–October) offers longer daylight, more stable weather, and better trail conditions. Summer provides the most daylight but can be hot; autumn brings cooler temperatures and fall colors. Winter hikes are possible but more challenging due to mud, reduced daylight, and potential ice; plan carefully and consider shorter distances.",
