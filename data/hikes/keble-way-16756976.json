    "summary": "Keble Way is a challenging long-distance hike totaling 84 kilometers in the United Kingdom. The route traverses varied countryside and rural paths, demanding sustained endurance, solid navigation, and careful pacing, whether completed as a multi-day trek or long single-day segments.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of quiet country lanes, farmland tracks, moorland paths, woodland trails, and occasional rocky or muddy sections. Terrain can be rolling to hilly with exposed upland areas, so good footwear and weather protection are essential; UK weather can change quickly across the route.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multi-day trekking or strenuous day hikes. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours before starting; UK conditions can be unpredictable. Navigation: carry a detailed map and compass and know how to use them; don't rely solely on mobile devices. Share your itinerary with someone and have an emergency plan. Water and food: carry enough water for several hours and have high-energy food; know water sources and consider purification if needed. Foot care: break in boots, carry blister care, and pace yourself to prevent injuries. Weather and daylight: be prepared for rain, wind, cold, or heat; adjust plans accordingly. Emergency gear: carry a whistle, headlamp, space blanket, and a compact first aid kit; know how to call for help (999 in the UK). Leave-no-trace and livestock considerations: respect gates, fences, and farm animals; carry out all rubbish.",
