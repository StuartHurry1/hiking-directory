    "summary": "Merrick Trail is a 13.8 km moderate hike in the UK that combines woodland sections, open grassy slopes, and occasional rocky patches. The route offers steady elevation gain, scenic views, and a rewarding day out for hikers with some trail experience.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied mix of forest tracks, grassy paths, and some exposed rocky stretches. The surface can be muddy after rain, and footing may be uneven in places. Navigation is straightforward on well-marked paths, but bring a map as weather conditions can change quickly in the countryside.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan with daylight: check the forecast and start early in winter. Tell someone your route and expected return time. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layered, weather-appropriate clothing. Bring a map and compass or a GPS device, and keep a charged phone as a backup. Stay on marked paths, watch for slippery rocks and mud, and avoid gaps or exposed edges in wet weather. Carry enough water and snacks, a small first aid kit, and an emergency whistle. If conditions deteriorate or you feel unwell, turn back.",
