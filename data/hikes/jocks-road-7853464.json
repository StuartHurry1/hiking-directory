    "summary": "Jock's Road is a demanding 32-kilometer hike in the United Kingdom, offering a remote, continuous trekking experience with substantial elevation gain. Intended for experienced hikers, it challenges stamina, navigation, and weather resilience, and can take a full day or longer depending on pace and conditions.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain is varied and can be technical in places: woodland tracks, open moorland, rocky sections, boggy ground, and occasional stream crossings. Expect uneven footing, long sections of exposed weather, and potential detours for navigation or fatigue. Steep ascents and descended long grades are common, and remote stretches may have limited cell coverage.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long, isolated day; inform someone of your route and expected finish. Check the forecast; UK weather can change quickly, especially on open moorland. Carry OS map and compass (and/or a GPS device) and do not rely solely on a phone. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring extra layers and waterproofs. Bring enough food and water (2–3 liters depending on conditions) and a water treatment option if needed. Pack an emergency shelter or bivvy, a first aid kit, and a whistle. Have a headtorch with spare batteries; consider a power bank for devices. In winter or wet conditions, the route may be impassable; be prepared to turn back.",
