    "summary": "A challenging long-distance coastal trek along the England Coast Path from Easington to Filey Brigg, covering about 151.9 km of cliff tops, beaches, and tidal estuaries. Expect exposed winds, variable weather, remote stretches, and a demanding pace for sustained hiking.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines cliff-top paths, shingle beaches, tidal flats, and rocky headlands. Surfaces are often uneven with loose stones, steps, and sections that flood at high tide. Expect exposed seascapes, steep climbs, mud in wetter seasons, and occasional navigation along coastlines with sparse markers.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for rapidly changing weather conditions and strong coastal winds. Break the distance into manageable daily segments and inform someone of your itinerary. Carry a map, compass or GPS, plus a fully charged phone; have a backup power source. Be aware of tides and potential remote sections with limited signal. Wear sturdy boots, stay hydrated, carry sufficient food, and keep to marked paths near cliff edges. Include a lightweight emergency shelter or space blanket and a basic first-aid kit.",
