    "summary": "A challenging coastal to inland trek across northern England from Shap to Richmond. The route covers about 201.5 km and blends fell country, moorland, river valleys and dramatic scenery with long ascents and exposed sections.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain is varied and strenuous. Expect rugged fell paths, stony tracks, moorland heaths, gentle river valleys, farm lanes and occasional road sections. Long ascents, exposed ridgelines and boggy stretches after rain are common. Weather can be highly changeable, bringing wind, mist and sudden showers.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan as a multi day trek with careful navigation. The route includes remote sections where mobile signal is limited, so carry a map and compass and know how to use them. Check weather forecasts in advance and be prepared for rapid changes. Start early each day to maximise daylight and avoid walking after dusk in exposed areas. Carry enough water and high energy food, and know resupply points along the way. Inform someone of your planned route and expected finish times. Wear sturdy boots and dress in layers, with a waterproof jacket and warm mid layer. Be prepared for boggy ground and river ford opportunities. In an emergency, call local rescue services and carry a whistle and an emergency shelter or bivy bag.",
