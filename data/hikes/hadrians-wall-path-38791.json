    "summary": "Hadrian's Wall Path is a hard, long-distance hike along the historic Roman frontier in northern England. At 299.1 km, it challenges seasoned trekkers with varied terrain, frequent ascents, and days spent in remote countryside across rugged moorland, farmland, and stone-built sites. The region is listed as Unknown, within the UK, and the distance implies multiple days of trekking across diverse conditions.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of well-graded trails, rough field paths, rocky stiles, and occasional road sections. Terrain ranges from soft moorland and peat bogs to crisp paths near settlements, with exposed ridges and long ascents. Weather can be windy and wet, and footing can be uneven or slippery in places.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a remote, long-distance route with limited daily services. Plan for self-sufficiency, especially on stretches with few resupply points. Weather in northern England can be highly variable; prepare for wind, rain, and cold, even in summer. Navigation is generally straightforward on the main route, but carry map/compass or a reliable GPS. Ensure proper footwear and clothing, carry a basic first aid kit, inform someone of your itinerary, and have a contingency plan for bad weather or injury; check rights of way and accommodation options ahead of time.",
