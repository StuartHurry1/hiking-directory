    "summary": "The Barnsley Boundary Walk is a challenging 191.2 km long-distance circuit around the Barnsley area in the United Kingdom. This hard route combines rural farmland, moorland paths, canal towpaths, and occasional urban stretches, demanding stamina, solid navigation skills, and reliable weather protection from experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied mix of terrain, including quiet country lanes, hedged fields, woodlands, canal towpaths, muddy footpaths, and both gradual and steep ascents. The route traverses open moorland sections, exposed stretches, and periods of uneven or rugged footing. Much of the way follows public rights of way and minor roads; footing is generally good on established paths but can be very muddy after rain. Navigation can be challenging at times due to long distances between waypoints.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long and physically demanding hike. Plan for variable UK weather, shorter daylight hours in winter, and potential road sections. Do not attempt without adequate preparation: carry OS maps or a GPS device, a charged phone, a reliable map-reading method, a first aid kit, and enough food and water. Tell someone your route and expected return times, start early, and be prepared to shorten or split the hike if weather deteriorates. Take care on road crossings and ensure you have high-visibility clothing in low light. In wet conditions, be aware of slippery paths and boggy patches; in winter, anticipate cold temperatures and strong winds, and adjust gear accordingly.",
