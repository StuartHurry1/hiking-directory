    "summary": "A demanding 20.3 km circular hike to Lost Lad and Back Tor in the High Peak area. This hard route traverses rocky paths, exposed moorland, and steep ascents, with potential boggy sections and rewarding views across the Derbyshire countryside.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rocky, uneven trails, grassy moorland sections, intermittent stone steps, and occasional muddy bogginess. Some parts are exposed with thin footing and short scrambles; navigation is important as not all paths are clearly marked. Prepared for long distances with frequent ascents and descents.",
    "safety_notes": "Distance and elevation demand good fitness; weather can change rapidly in the Peak District, so carry waterproofs and extra layers. Wear sturdy footwear with good grip, bring a map and compass (and know how to use them) or a reliable GPS. Pack enough water and food, sun protection in clear weather, a hat for sun or cold, and a headlamp for late finishes. Tell someone your route and expected return, and consider emergency gear such as a whistle and space blanket. Be mindful of boggy sections and keep to established paths to protect the environment.",
