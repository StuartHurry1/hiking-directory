    "summary": "Langstone Harbour Waterside Route is a challenging 53.6 km coastal hike around Langstone Harbour in the UK. The route follows a mix of paved paths, boardwalks, and shoreline tracks along estuaries and salt marshes, offering seabird watching and harbour views. It is a strenuous, long-distance trek that benefits from careful planning around tides, weather, and daylight.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly flat to gently undulating coastal terrain with long waterfront sections. Expect a mix of asphalt, gravel, boardwalks, and occasional soft sand along beaches and tidal flats. Tidal conditions can affect segments and provide mud or slippery surfaces; wind and spray are common on exposed stretches.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide tables and plan around tidal windows to avoid getting cut off from shore. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and dress in layers; UK coastal weather can change quickly. Carry sufficient water and food, a map or GPS, a fully charged phone, and a basic first-aid kit. Stay on marked paths, watch for slippery boardwalks, and be mindful of local wildlife and protected areas. Inform someone of your plans and expected finish time; daylight may be limited in winter.",
