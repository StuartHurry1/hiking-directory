    "summary": "The Avon Valley Path is a strenuous long-distance route in the UK, spanning 704 km along the Avon corridor. It weaves through river valleys, farmland, woodlands, and open countryside, offering a demanding multi-day challenge with varied scenery and frequent changes in terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of riverbank paths, hedgerow borders, rural tracks, and woodland trails. Surfaces range from compact dirt and gravel to muddy fields and uneven roots. Some sections may be flooded after rain, with occasional gentle to moderate climbs and stile crossings.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard, long-distance hike requiring careful planning. Prepare for variable UK weather, limited daylight in winter, and remote stretches with few services. Always map the route, carry navigation tools, inform someone of your itinerary, and plan for multiple overnight stops or camping opportunities. Stay hydrated, watch footing on wet surfaces, and have contingency plans for river crossings and trail closures.",
