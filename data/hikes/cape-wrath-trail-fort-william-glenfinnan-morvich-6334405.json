    "summary": "The Cape Wrath Trail is a rigorous, remote wilderness trek across Scotland’s West Highlands, stretching about 232 km from Fort William to Morvich (often via Glenfinnan and surrounding paths). It features rugged mountains, long moorland tracts, peat bogs, river crossings, and exposed coastal sections, requiring solid navigation, fitness, and self-sufficiency over multiple days.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain ranges from high mountain ridges and rocky corries to soft peat bogs and open moorland. Expect long, often featureless legs between water sources, river crossings with changing water levels, and coastal sections exposed to wind and spray. Navigation is essential, and weather can turn quickly; plan for remote camping with limited resupply points.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard wilderness route with remote sections and rapid weather changes. Hazards include sudden storms, hypothermia, dehydration, fatigue, river crossings, and navigation errors. Always carry a loot plan and beacon, share your itinerary, check forecasts, and ensure you have a means to call for help. Know your limits, carry sufficient reserves, and camp responsibly.",
