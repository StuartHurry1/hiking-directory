    "summary": "A challenging 20.9 km hike from Auchnafree to Newton in the UK, suited for experienced walkers. The route combines varied terrain, elevation changes and potentially boggy sections, demanding good fitness, navigation and preparation.",

    "safety_notes": "Check the forecast and daylight hours before setting out. Carry a map and compass (and know how to use them) or a GPS device; share your route and expected turnaround time with someone.

Stay hydrated, carry sufficient food, and have a first aid kit, whistle, and a charged phone as an emergency backup. In winter, expect harsher conditions and shorter daylight; adjust plans accordingly.",
