    "summary": "A scenic 8.5 km coastal wildlife walk around Brancaster Staithe on the North Norfolk coast. The moderate-level route combines marshland and coastal paths with ample birdlife and shorelines; expect flat sections, occasional boardwalks, and possible mud, making sturdy footwear and weather-appropriate layers advisable.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly flat to gently undulating coastal terrain. The route mixes gravel paths, tidal estuary boardwalks, grassy tidal banks, and some muddy sections, especially after rain. Sections along marshes can be exposed to wind; watch for wet/muddy patches near the shore.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times before starting; some areas are inaccessible at high tide due to tides and mud. Wear sturdy, waterproof footwear and dress in layers; coastal weather can change quickly. Follow marked paths near wildlife reserves and keep dogs on a lead if required. Carry water, a basic map or GPS, a charged phone, and a small first aid kit. Be mindful of wind and cold; in an emergency call 999.",
