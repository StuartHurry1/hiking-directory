    "summary": "A strenuous 34 km circular hike through Flatford and the Constable Country along the River Stour in the UK. The route blends rural lanes, woodland, pasture, and water meadows with several gates and stiles. Expect long, exposed walking, uneven ground, and muddy sections; a well-planned day with solid navigation is essential.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily rural footpaths and country lanes, with some tarmac, muddy fields, and intermittent wetlands. Expect uneven terrain, stiles, gentle to moderate ascents, and potential flooding after wet weather. Scenic views over Dedham Vale and the River Stour accompany the route.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for 8–10 hours. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and layered clothing; UK weather can change quickly, so bring a waterproof jacket and a warm layer. Carry enough water and snacks for a full day, and have a map or offline navigation on your phone. Stay on public rights of way and respect livestock; close gates behind you. Be aware of mud, potential river crossings, and roads along the route. Inform someone of your plan, and carry a basic first aid kit and an emergency whistle. In winter, daylight is limited and paths can be more hazardous.",
