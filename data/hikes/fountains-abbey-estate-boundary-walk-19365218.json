    "summary": "A demanding 30.1 km circuit around the boundary of the Fountains Abbey Estate in the UK, weaving through historic grounds, pasture, woodland and occasional moorland. The route requires good navigation and stamina, with long stretches on uneven trails and several gates and stiles.",

Be prepared for mud, boggy sections and uneven ground; watch for cattle in fields and road crossings near the estate. Carry sufficient water and food, a first aid kit, and weather-appropriate clothing. In poor visibility or storms, consider turning back.",
