    "summary": "This hard, long-distance hike covers roughly 46.1 km along the Midlothian Core Paths in the UK. It blends urban pavements, woodland trails, and rural lanes, with multiple short climbs contributing to a demanding overall ascent. Good navigation and solid preparation are essential, and hikers should plan for variable weather and daylight.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain varies from tarmac and compacted gravel to muddy forest trails and quiet country lanes. Expect gates and occasional stiles, with undulating ground and several short ascents rather than a single long climb. Footing can be uneven after rain, so waterproof footwear is advised.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day or split into two; tell someone your route and timings; bring a map and compass or GPS; check weather and daylight; carry sufficient water and food; wear appropriate footwear; be prepared for mud, rain, and occasional road crossings; watch for busy urban sections and ensure proper navigation in rural parts.",
