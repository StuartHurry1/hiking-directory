    "summary": "Gordano Round is a challenging long-distance circular hike in the United Kingdom, covering approximately 91.3 km. The route tests endurance with varied terrain and is rated hard, weaving coastal paths, farmland, and rural lanes with changing scenery.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect coastal paths along estuaries, grassy tracks, hedgerows, farm lanes, occasional road sections, and uneven, muddy footpaths. Stiles and gates are common; some segments can be boggy after rain and navigation may require careful map reading.",
    "safety_notes": "Treat as a strenuous undertaking: plan as a multi-day route or a very long day. UK weather can change rapidly; carry layers and waterproofs. Navigation skills are essential; bring a map and compass even if using a GPS backup. Inform someone of your route and expected return. Carry 2–3 liters of water per person, high-energy food, and a first aid kit. Wear sturdy boots with good grip; be prepared for steep ascents and exposed sections. Be mindful of daylight limits, sea spray on coastal parts, and livestock. Have a contingency plan if conditions worsen.",
