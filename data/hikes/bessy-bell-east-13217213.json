    "summary": "Bessy Bell East is a moderate 8.4 km hike in the UK, offering a mix of open upland trails and gentle ascents. With rolling terrain and potential boggy stretches, it suits hikers comfortable with a longer trek and variable weather. The route delivers scenic views and a sense of isolation typical of UK countryside uplands.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of grassy paths, compact gravel, and occasional rocky or uneven sections. Some stretches may be wet or muddy, especially after rain; stiles or gates are possible. The route traverses open moorland with manageable elevation gain and exposed sections, so waterproof gear and sturdy boots are advised.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for changeable UK weather and possible limited daylight. Carry a map and compass (or GPS), inform someone of your planned route and return time, and stay on marked paths. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear, bring extra layers, and pack sufficient water and snacks. Be aware of livestock, avoid the route in icy or high-wind conditions, and know when to turn back if visibility worsens.",
