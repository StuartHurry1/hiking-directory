    "summary": "A demanding 29.3 km ridge-focused hike combining Hermitage, Rumbling Bridge and Inchewan Burn. The route weaves along exposed ridgelines, across boggy moorland and through woodland, with several long ascents and descents. It is best tackled by experienced hikers seeking panoramic views and a serious endurance challenge.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect rugged, exposed ridges with uneven footing, short steeper scrambles, and continuous ups and downs. The terrain includes rocky sections, peat bogs, wet vegetated flats, streams crossings, and occasional woodland. Weather can change rapidly in the UK, so navigation and route-finding are important, and visibility can be reduced on misty days.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, strenuous route with potential for rapid weather changes. Ensure you have a reliable map and compass or GPS, know how to use them, and inform someone of your plans. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers; carry a waterproof shell, extra warm layer, and a means to light a fire or signal for help if needed. Be prepared for boggy ground and possible river crossings; turn back if conditions deteriorate or daylight is fading.",
