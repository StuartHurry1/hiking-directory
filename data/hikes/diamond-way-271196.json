    "summary": "Diamond Way is a demanding long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, covering approximately 238.7 km. It challenges endurance with sustained distances, varied terrain, and significant elevation gains, making it suited to experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses a mix of countryside, upland moorland, woodlands, and potential coastal or urban segments. Expect rolling hills, exposed ridges, and frequent changes in surfaces, including tracks, grassy paths, and stony trails.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard, long-distance trek; plan for multi-day travel and rest if needed. Check weather forecasts—the UK weather can change rapidly, especially in upland sections. Navigation is essential: carry a map and compass and don't rely solely on smartphones; have a GPS backup. Tell someone your itinerary and consider a personal locator beacon for remote segments. Bring enough water and high-energy food; refill points may be scarce in remote sections. Wear sturdy footwear and carry layered clothing plus a waterproof outer layer; include a hat and gloves for colder conditions. Pack a basic first-aid kit, blister care, a whistle, and emergency shelter; know how to use them. Stay on marked paths where possible and respect local access rules.",
