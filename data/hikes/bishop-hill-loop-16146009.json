    "summary": "The Bishop Hill Loop is a challenging 21.6 km circuit in the UK, suited to experienced hikers. It combines long distance with varied terrain and several ascents, including exposed sections and potential muddy or wet conditions.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed countryside terrain: grassy paths, rocky tracks, hedgerows, and occasional road sections. Expect uphill climbs, uneven footing, and muddy patches after rain; gates and stiles are likely, and navigation may be required in unfamiliar areas.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a full-day hike (approximately 6–8 hours). The UK weather can change quickly, so bring waterproof layers and appropriate clothing. Carry a map and compass (GPS as backup), a fully charged phone with a power bank, and sufficient water (2–3 L) and high-energy snacks. Wear sturdy, waterproof boots and be prepared for uneven, potentially slippery surfaces. Have a lightweight emergency layer or bivvy, sun protection, and basic first aid. Follow markers, monitor livestock where present, and inform someone of your route and expected return time.",
