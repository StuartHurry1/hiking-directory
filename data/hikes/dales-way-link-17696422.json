    "summary": "The Dales Way Link is a challenging 51.2 km long-distance hike in the UK that crosses varied countryside near the Dales. Expect rolling farmland, moorland, streams and occasional ascents as you follow public paths and field margins. Because of the distance and elevation, most hikers complete it as a multi-day trek or a strenuous long day.",
    "terrain_summary": "Trail types range from grassy farmland paths and stone steps to upland moorland and occasional road sections. Some sections can be wet or boggy after rain, and parts may be exposed on higher ground. Navigation is generally straightforward on waymarked routes, but a map and compass are advisable in case of detours.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for variable UK weather and a long day or multi-day hike. Tell someone your route and estimated return. Carry a map and compass and know how to use them. Wear sturdy boots and layered clothing, and be prepared for wind, rain, and sun. Stay hydrated, carry enough food, and have a means to signal for help (whistle). Watch for cattle and livestock; close gates behind you. In remote sections, mobile signal may be limited—carry a backup contact method and a small emergency kit.",
