    "summary": "Lime Craig Trail is a 10.4 km moderate hike in the UK, offering a mix of grassy paths, woodlands, and rocky sections. It suits hikers with a reasonable fitness level and provides varied scenery without significant technical climbs.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed terrain: rolling grassy tracks, leaf litter and potential mud, woodland sections, and uneven rocky stretches. Some exposed viewpoints may require careful footing; the route includes a moderate elevation gain and can be slippery in wet conditions.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for 3–4 hours to complete. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and bring weather-appropriate clothing. Stay on marked paths and bring a map or GPS; check local conditions, as UK weather can change quickly. Be prepared for muddy sections, uneven ground, and occasional exposed rocks. In rural areas, watch for livestock and keep noise down to avoid startling wildlife. Carry enough water and snacks, and have a basic first aid kit and a fully charged phone. If hiking alone, inform someone of your route and expected return time.",
