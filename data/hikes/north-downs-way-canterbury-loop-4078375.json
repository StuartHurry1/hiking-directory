    "summary": "A demanding 96.4 km loop following the North Downs Way near Canterbury in the UK. The route combines rolling chalk downs, farmland, woodland trails, and rural lanes for a rugged, long-distance trekking experience with significant elevation gain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect rolling chalk downs with exposed uplands, hedgerows and pasture, woodlands, and occasional coastal glimpses. The surface varies from well-marked trail sections to rough paths and field margins. Elevation gain is substantial, with long stretches of steady uphill and downhill sections.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a strenuous long-distance hike. Plan for multiple days, check weather forecasts, and carry navigation tools (map and compass or GPS). Be prepared for sudden UK weather, limited phone reception in rural areas, and seasonal mud. Start early, carry enough water and food, and inform someone of your itinerary. Respect wildlife and farm gates; leave no trace and follow waymarks.",
