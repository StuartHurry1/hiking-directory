    "summary": "The Icknield Way Path is a challenging long-distance hike across the UK, covering about 569.3 km. Designed for experienced walkers, it traverses varied countryside and rural landscapes, with frequent changes in terrain and wayfinding. This guide outlines what to expect, safety considerations, gear, and the best time to tackle the route.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of farmland tracks, bridleways, footpaths, hedge-lined lanes, chalk downland, woodlands and occasional road sections. Terrain can range from dry, firm paths to muddy fields after rain. Some sections are exposed on open uplands; gates and stiles are common. Distances between resupply points can be long, so plan for self-sufficiency over remote stretches.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan your route in advance, tell someone your itinerary, and check weather forecasts. The UK climate can be changeable; carry waterproof clothing and warm layers. Wear sturdy boots with good ankle support, bring a map and compass (and know how to use them), and carry a GPS as backup. Carry sufficient water and food, plus a means to purify water. Be mindful of livestock and gates, and take care crossing roads in rural sections. Have a spare light, first aid kit, blister care, and a means to signal for help. In case of emergencies, know local emergency numbers (112/999 in the UK).",
