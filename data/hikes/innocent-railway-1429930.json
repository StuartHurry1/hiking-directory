    "summary": "A challenging long-distance hike along the Innocent Railway route in the UK, covering 34.2 km. This hard trail follows a former rail line with varied surfaces, remote sections, and scenic countryside, suitable for experienced hikers seeking a demanding day or short multi-day trek.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily a rail-trail surface with a mix of compacted gravel, hard-packed earth, and occasional uneven ties. Expect muddy patches after rain and open exposed sections. Grades are steady rather than steep, but long distances require endurance; some sections may have fences, bridges, or private access considerations.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan your hike for daylight hours and check the weather. Tell someone your route and expected return time. Carry a map or GPS, a fully charged phone, and a compass. Bring water and enough food for the distance plus extras. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers; carry a rain jacket. Be aware that remote sections may have poor mobile coverage. Stay on the official path, watch for fences and private property, and check for trail closures before you go. Take regular breaks to manage fatigue and consider splitting the hike into two days if needed. Respect wildlife and local landowners.",
