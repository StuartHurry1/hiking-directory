    "summary": "A short, easy 2.4 km segment of the London LOOP labeled Section 16 unsigned alternative. This hike provides a quick taste of London’s countryside without a long distance, and it may have limited signage due to being an unsigned variant, so navigation prep is advised.",
    "terrain_summary": "Varied but accessible terrain: paved paths, gravel tracks, and some grassy or uneven sections. The unsigned variant means markers may be sparse, so expect occasional navigation challenges and plan ahead. The route is generally flat with gentle surfaces.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan ahead for limited wayfinding on this unsigned variant. Bring a map or GPS, and a compass if possible. Check the weather and wear sturdy footwear. Stay on the route where marked, and be mindful of traffic where it runs alongside roads. Carry water, snacks, and a small first-aid kit. Keep dogs under control and on a short leash. Daylight can be limited in winter, so consider timing your walk accordingly and have a light source if needed.",
