    "summary": "A long, hard hike of 21.9 km along the route of the former Brill Tramway in the English countryside. The walk combines rural lanes, grassy rail-bed sections, and open farmland with steady, sustained effort required. Best suited to experienced hikers with good footwear and ample daylight.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily along the disused Brill Tramway bed and surrounding rural paths. Surfaces include compacted gravel on the old rail bed, grassy track, dirt paths, and occasional mud at field edges. Expect gentle to moderate climbs, several stiles and gates, and occasional road crossings. Weather can make ground slick; waterproof footwear is advised.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long, remote stretch with limited facilities; carry a map and compass or GPS, and ensure your phone is charged. Be prepared for uneven ground and loose ballast on the old track bed, plus muddy grass after rain. Watch for changing weather, winter ice, and sun exposure in summer. Rural roads may have traffic and cyclists at crossings; check for path closures before you go and start early to ensure daylight. Bring water, a small first aid kit, and a lightweight emergency layer.",
