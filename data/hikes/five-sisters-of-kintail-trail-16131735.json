    "summary": "The Five Sisters of Kintail Trail is a demanding 19.9 km ridge walk in the Scottish Highlands. It links five prominent summits along a rugged crest, offering expansive Highland views. The route is rewarding but challenging, requiring good fitness, solid navigation, and respect for exposed sections and rapidly changing weather.",

Carry map and compass and know how to use them; avoid reliance on smartphones alone. Wear sturdy boots and dress in layers with windproof and waterproof outerwear.

Start early, hike with a partner if possible, and be prepared to turn back if weather deteriorates or visibility drops.",
