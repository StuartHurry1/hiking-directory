    "summary": "Mineral Valleys Walk: Rookhope is a 13.3 km moderate hike in the UK that threads through historic mining lands around Rookhope. The route combines open moorland, remnants of mineral works, and long grassy paths with some gentle ascents and descents and occasional rocky sections. Expect scenic views, occasional wind, and a steady pace suitable for walkers with moderate experience and good footwear.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily rough moorland and stony tracks with sections of boggy ground and uneven, rocky footing. Some well-defined paths exist, but parts can be indistinct in poor visibility. The route features a mix of gentle gradients and longer climbs with exposed stretches.",
    "safety_notes": "Upland weather can change rapidly. Check forecast and bring multiple layers, a waterproof jacket, and sturdy boots. Navigation benefits from a current map and compass; GPS can help but may not work in remote areas. Expect uneven ground, boggy patches, and occasional rocky sections. The area is remote with limited mobile reception—inform someone of your plan and expected finish time. Allow extra time in wet conditions and be mindful of livestock, fences, and potential ford crossings. In winter, wind, ice, and snow increase risk; avoid exposed ridges in severe conditions.",
