    "summary": "A challenging long-distance hike along the historic Cross Borders Drove Road from Traquair to Hawick in the Scottish Borders. At 63.2 km, it is rated hard and is typically tackled as a multi-day trek by experienced hikers, though a well-prepared day hike is possible for very fit walkers. The route offers remote upland scenery, border-country history, and a mix of road, track, and rural paths.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily a drove road with mixed surfaces: sealed road in places, compacted track, and muddy sections. Expect rolling countryside, occasional longer ascents, and remote stretches with limited facilities. Navigation and planning are important in poor weather or when signage is sparse.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan thoroughly for a long trek and consider splitting the route into two days. Carry a map and compass or GPS, and know your start and end points. Weather in the Scottish Borders can change rapidly; bring appropriate clothing and emergency shelter. Water and food may be scarce along the route, so carry enough supplies. Wear sturdy boots, use sun protection in warm weather, and carry a basic first-aid kit and a whistle. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected times, and be mindful of road traffic on open sections and livestock movements.",
