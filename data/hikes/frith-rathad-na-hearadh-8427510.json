    "summary": "Frith-Rathad na Hearadh is a demanding long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, spanning 75.3 km with a hard difficulty rating. The route combines varied terrain, remote sections, and several elevation changes, making pace and endurance key. It can be tackled as a multi-day trek or a strenuous day hike for experienced hikers who are well-prepared and self-sufficient.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rough moorland, grassy trails, rocky outcrops, boggy sections, and occasional forest paths. The path quality varies from well-defined tracks to cross-country routes, with potential river crossings and long ascents and descents. Weather can be highly changeable in the UK, so conditions can impact footing and visibility on exposed ridges.",
    "safety_notes": "- Distance and elevation demand thorough planning; consider multi-day trips with overnight stops. - Carry a detailed map and compass; GPS is helpful but do not rely on it exclusively. - Check local weather and daylight hours; expect rain, wind, and cold, even in summer. - Wear sturdy, ankle-supporting boots; bring extra socks and layers. - Stay on the route; in remote sections, navigation errors can lead to long detours. - Inform someone of your itinerary and expected return. - Pack a lightweight emergency kit (whistle, space blanket, first aid). - Carry enough food and water; plan for water sources and water treatment. - Be prepared for limited cell coverage in remote parts.",
