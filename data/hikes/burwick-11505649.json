    "summary": "Burwick is a challenging 23.2 km hike in the UK characterized by rugged, exposed terrain and significant elevation gain. It suits experienced hikers willing to plan for changeable weather and long distances, with navigation and fitness playing key roles.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect varied, rugged terrain: steep ascents and descents, rocky tracks, marshy or muddy sections, and exposed ridges. Weather can shift quickly, especially near coastlines, so footing and navigation require attention and proper footwear.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the forecast and plan for daylight. Use map and compass (don’t rely solely on GPS); carry a charged device and route knowledge. Start early to ensure finish during daylight; pace yourself to avoid fatigue. Wear layered, weatherproof clothing and bring waterproofs. Carry sufficient water and food, plus a basic first aid kit and emergency signaling (whistle). Stay on marked paths, be mindful of unstable ground and slippery rocks, and let someone know your route and expected return. In coastal areas, be aware of tides and sea spray; carry a means to call for help if needed.",
