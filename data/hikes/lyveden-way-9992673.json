    "summary": "Lyveden Way is a challenging long-distance hike in the UK, roughly 27.8 km in length. The route traverses a variety of countryside near Lyveden, mixing rural lanes, farmland, woodlands, and open sections with occasional gentle climbs.

    "terrain_summary": "A mixed surface route combining rural track, grassy field margins, woodland trails, and occasional open moorland. Expect uneven ground, short steep sections, stiles, gates, and muddy patches after rain. Some stretches can be exposed to wind; navigation is straightforward but a map or GPS backup is recommended.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day: start early and allow ample time to complete within daylight. Wear sturdy footwear and bring weather-appropriate clothing; waterproofs are essential in the UK. Carry a map and compass as GPS may fail or be unreliable in rural sections. Stay on public rights of way and respect farmland; keep dogs under control and watch for livestock. Bring enough water and snacks, and carry a basic first aid kit and a whistle. Check the weather forecast and avoid the route in severe conditions; tell someone your plan and expected finish time.",
