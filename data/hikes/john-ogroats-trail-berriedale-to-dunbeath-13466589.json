    "summary": "A coastal 12.9 km section of the John O'Groats Trail from Berriedale to Dunbeath in the UK. This moderate hike offers rugged cliffs, grassy moorland, and sweeping sea views along the northeast Scottish coast, with varying terrain and occasional exposed stretches.",
    "terrain_summary": "Coastal route with mixed terrain: grassy tracks, rocky footing, some boggy patches, and sections along cliff edges. Expect exposed stretches and intermittent sea spray. Ground can be slippery in wet weather; navigation is straightforward but map reading helps in less marked areas.",
    "safety_notes": "Coastal exposure with rapidly changing weather and strong winds. Tidal risks may affect access in parts of the route; stay on marked paths and keep a safe distance from cliff edges. Wear sturdy boots, bring a map or GPS, and carry extra clothing, water, and food. Let someone know your plan and estimated return time; start early in poorer daylight seasons. Use sun protection in sunny conditions and be cautious of remote road traffic.",
