    "summary": "The Kingfisher Trail is a demanding 22-kilometer hike in the UK, suited for experienced trekkers. It traverses varied terrain with significant elevation and long miles, offering rewards in views and solitude when conditions cooperate.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines well-maintained paths with muddy sections, rocky ascents, and exposed stretches. Footing can be uneven and slippery after rain, and elevation gain is substantial for a 22 km hike. Terrain and scenery can vary by region within the UK.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for 4–7 hours of hiking depending on pace and conditions. Check local weather and daylight hours, as UK weather can change rapidly. Carry a map and compass as a backup to GPS, and know how to use them. Tell someone your planned route and ETA. Stay hydrated and bring extra food. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and dress in layered clothing; bring a waterproof jacket and gloves in cold or wet conditions. Be prepared for mud, boggy sections, and rough terrain. Stay on marked paths, pack out all rubbish, and be mindful of gates and livestock. In remote sections, carry a small emergency bivy or space blanket and a whistle for signaling.",
