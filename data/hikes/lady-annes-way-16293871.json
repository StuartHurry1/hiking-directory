    "summary": "Lady Anne's Way is a demanding long-distance trail in the UK, covering about 296 km. It traverses a mix of rural farmland, small villages, and varied countryside, requiring steady pacing and solid navigation from experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed terrain: fields, hedged lanes, occasional forest tracks, and some road sections. Surfaces can be uneven with stiles and gates, and there may be upland or exposed sections depending on the route.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a multi-day trek with long daily distances; plan rest stops and overnight stops in advance. Carry a detailed map and compass as backup to GPS, and ensure you know the route. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours before setting out; UK weather can change rapidly. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected finish times. Bring sufficient water and high-energy food; water sources can be scarce in rural sections. Wear sturdy, waterproof footwear and dress in layers; be prepared for rain, wind, and cold. Be aware of livestock, farm crossings, and road traffic on rural sections. Pack a basic first aid kit and a lightweight emergency shelter, and practice navigation and signaling in case of difficulties. Consider a guidebook or offline maps if signal is unreliable.",
