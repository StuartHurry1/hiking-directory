    "summary": "Forest Way (Sussex) is a demanding long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, totaling 36.6 km. The route traverses woodland and rural countryside in Sussex, offering a mix of shaded forest paths, chalk tracks, and occasional open sections. The hike suits experienced walkers who can sustain a steady pace over a long day.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of forest trails, chalky tracks, and occasional muddy sections. The route involves rolling hills with several ascents and descents, and surfaces can be uneven with roots and loose stones. Weather and wet ground can make sections slick; some stretches are exposed to wind in open fields.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard distance hike. Plan for a long day (and possibly more with delays). Carry a map and compass or a GPS device; do not rely solely on a phone signal in remote sections. Check the forecast and be prepared for rain, cold, and mud. Wear sturdy footwear with good grip and layered clothing. Stay on marked paths, respect farmland and private property, and close gates after passage. Tell someone your route and expected return. Bring a basic first aid kit, food, water (2-3 liters), a headlamp or torch, a whistle, and emergency shelter if overnighting.",
