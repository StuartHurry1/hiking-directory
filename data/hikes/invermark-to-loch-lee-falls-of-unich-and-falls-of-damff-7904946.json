The route traverses open moorland, riverbanks, and wooded sections, delivering views of dramatic waterfalls and rugged Highland scenery. Allow 4–6 hours depending on detours and pace; suitable for hikers with moderate experience and good footwear.",
    "terrain_summary": "The path starts on a maintained track from Invermark, then crosses open moorland with occasional boggy patches. Expect uneven ground, rocky sections, and intermittent streams. Detours to the Falls of Unich and Falls of Damff bring you close to cascades along uneven rocky terrain, with slippery areas near spray. The route approaches Loch Lee through woodland and shorelines, with some gentle ascents and descents.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a remote UK hike with limited mobile coverage. Weather can change quickly; carry extra clothing. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring a waterproof layer. Expect muddy and slippery surfaces, especially near waterfalls and after rain. Some river crossings and wet ground can be hazardous; use caution on exposed rock and near cascades. Plan your timing for daylight and inform someone of your route. Carry map and compass (or GPS), food and water, a basic first-aid kit, and a whistle.",
