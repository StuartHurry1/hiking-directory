    "summary": "The Mull of Galloway Trail is a challenging 58.7 km coastal long-distance route in the UK. It follows rugged sea cliffs and grassy headlands around the Rhins of Galloway, delivering remote sections, panoramic coastal views, and a physically demanding undertaking for experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily coastal cliff paths and grassy tracks with occasional farm lanes and short road sections.

Plan for 2–3 days or a strenuous full-day hike, depending on pace. Inform someone of your itinerary, carry a map and navigation tools, and be aware mobile signal may be limited in remote sections. Stay clear of unstable cliff edges, check weather conditions, and carry sufficient water and food.",
