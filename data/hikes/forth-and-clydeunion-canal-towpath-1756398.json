    "summary": "The Forth & Clyde/Union Canal Towpath is a long-distance hike tracing Scotland's historic canal corridors from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde. At 205.8 km, it offers a demanding multi-day trek that combines flat towpath walking with occasional locks, bridges, and urban sections, ideal for experienced hikers seeking a scenic endurance route.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily flat to gently undulating towpath along canal banks, surfaced in asphalt or compact gravel. Expect smooth stretches, but watch for muddy patches after rain, narrow sections beside water, lock approaches, and occasional detours through towns. Scenery includes waterway views, woodland cuttings, and historic canal structures.",
    "safety_notes": "This is an extended canal-side trek. Plan multi-day itineraries with reliable overnight options; share the path with cyclists where indicated and stay alert for pedestrian traffic. Carry a detailed map or GPS and a charged phone; bring sufficient water and high-energy snacks; monitor weather and canal flood risks; use sun protection in exposed sections; be mindful of midges in summer; ensure you can access water and restroom facilities at stops; inform someone of your route and expected checkpoints.",
