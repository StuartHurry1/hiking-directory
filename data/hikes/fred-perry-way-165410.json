    "summary": "Fred Perry Way is a challenging long-distance hike in the UK, spanning 91.9 km and rated hard. The route traverses varied landscapes and requires solid planning, endurance, and navigation. This guide covers what to expect, terrain, safety considerations, gear, and the best seasons to hike.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed surfaces: tarmac and gravel tracks, muddy bridleways, grassy paths, and occasional rocky sections. Elevation gain varies with several sustained ascents and some exposed sections. The route may cross woodlands, open moorland, and watercourses, so weather, footwear, and waterproofing are important. Navigation skills and a map or GPS device are recommended due to variable and potentially remote sections.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for long days in potentially remote sections. Check the forecast and plan around daylight; tell someone your route and expected finish time. Carry full navigation tools (map and compass or GPS) and a fully charged phone with offline maps. Bring adequate water and high-energy food for multi-day trekking. Wear appropriate footwear and clothing, monitor weather changes, and have a plan for emergencies. In the UK, dial 999 for emergencies and notify local landowners where appropriate.",
