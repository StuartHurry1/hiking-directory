    "summary": "Nickey Line is a 30.9 km hard-distance hike in the UK, following a former railway corridor. The route offers a long, mostly linear trek with mixed surfaces, from compact gravel and dirt paths to grassy verges, with occasional gradual climbs and some exposed sections. It’s best suited to experienced walkers with solid navigation and endurance, planning for a full day of trekking and variable weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "The hike runs along a rails-to-trails corridor with mostly even to gently undulating grades. Expect a mix of compacted gravel, hard-packed dirt, and grass with occasional muddy patches after rain. Some sections are exposed with limited shelter; waymarkers are generally present but rely on navigation in remote stretches.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, hard hike with potential remote segments. Check weather and daylight hours before starting; tell someone your plan and expected finish time. Wear sturdy boots, bring a map or GPS, sufficient water and food, and a basic first aid kit. Be mindful of muddy, slippery surfaces, and possible vagrant weather changes in the UK. Have a plan for navigation in case of poor signposting, and carry a whistle and emergency layer.",
