    "summary": "High Point Walk is a demanding 15.8 km trek in the UK, designed for experienced hikers. The route features long ascents to a high point, rugged terrain, and exposed sections. It rewards with sweeping views but requires solid navigation, planning, and sturdy gear.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect continuous ascents and descents over rough, uneven trails with rocky sections, grassy moorland, and potential boggy stretches. Paths can be muddy in wet weather, and exposed ridge sections may be windy. Navigation can be challenging in unknown terrain, so map and compass are essential.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a 6–8 hour round trip. Check weather and winds at height before starting. Wear sturdy boots and dress in layers; be prepared for sudden changes. Carry sufficient water and high-energy foods. Bring a map, compass (or reliable GPS), and a fully charged phone as backup. Have a head torch, whistle, first aid kit, and an emergency blanket. Stay on marked paths, watch for fatigue, and inform someone of your plan and expected return time.",
