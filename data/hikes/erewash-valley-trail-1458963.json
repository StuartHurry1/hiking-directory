    "summary": "The Erewash Valley Trail is a challenging long-distance route in the UK, spanning 159.6 km. The region is listed as Unknown region in the hike details, but the trail typically follows a mix of rural lanes, canal towpaths, and woodlands along the Erewash Valley. Designed for experienced hikers, the route rewards endurance with varied scenery, small villages, and glimpses of industrial heritage.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied mix of surfaces: flat canal towpaths for long stretches, hedged country lanes, meadow and woodland tracks, and short, steeper sections. Terrain may be muddy after rain and uneven in places; navigation is important in rural sections. Distances between settlements can be long, so plan accordingly.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan multi-day logistics with well-told routes. Carry map and compass or a reliable GPS device, and check weather forecasts. Bring adequate food and water, inform someone of your itinerary, and be prepared for gaps in mobile signal in remote sections. Some segments run along busy roads or through exposed countryside; dress for weather and daylight hours, and know the nearest emergency facilities.",
