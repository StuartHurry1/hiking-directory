    "summary": "A challenging coastal long-distance hike along the England Coast Path from Southend-on-Sea to Wallasea Island. Covering about 104.5 km, the route blends urban seafronts, estuary marshes, mudflats, and salt marshes, with significant exposure and a hard pacing requirement. It is typically completed as multiple days or long day stages.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route starts along Southend-on-Sea’s promenade and riverside defenses, then traverses estuary banks, mudflats exposed at low tide, shingle and sandy beaches, and wooden boardwalks through salt marshes toward Wallasea Island. Expect soft footing in mud, uneven coastal paths, and occasional seawall sections; weather and wind can create spray and challenging conditions. Some stretches may have limited shade and variable surface stability.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, exposed coastal route with tidal and weather-related hazards. Check tide tables for mudflat sections and plan around rising tides to avoid being cut off. Weather can change rapidly; bring extra layers, a waterproof shell, and sun protection. Footing can be slippery and uneven, so wear sturdy waterproof boots with good grip. Mobile signal can be weak in marshlands; carry a map and compass as backups and inform someone of your itinerary and timings. Carry enough food and water for multi-day segments and have a basic first-aid kit and emergency whistle.",
