    "summary": "A challenging 52.7 km coastal hike along the Inverness to Culbokie segment of the John O'Groats Trail in the UK. The route combines rugged shoreline paths, inland tracks, and some road walking, with significant elevation in places. It is best undertaken as a multi-day trip with careful planning, navigation, and contingency options.",
