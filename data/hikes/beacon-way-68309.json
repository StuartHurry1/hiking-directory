    "summary": "Beacon Way is a demanding long-distance hike in the UK, spanning about 122.2 km with varied terrain and lake scenery. Classified as hard, it suits experienced trekkers seeking a multi-day challenge and rewarding views.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed terrain: grassy uplands, rocky or muddy sections, lakefront paths, and occasional gravel tracks. Significant elevation changes and exposed sections can occur, and navigation may be tricky in poor visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan as a multi-day trek with a conservative timetable. Check weather forecasts, as UK conditions can change rapidly. Carry a map and compass (GPS as backup), inform someone of your route and daily progress, and start early to maximise daylight. Stay hydrated, conserve energy in exposed areas, and follow Leave No Trace principles; be prepared for limited shelter in some stretches.",
