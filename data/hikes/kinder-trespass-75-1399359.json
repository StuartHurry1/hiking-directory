    "safety_notes": "Check the weather forecast before you go; UK conditions on moorland can change rapidly. Wear sturdy waterproof hiking boots and dress in layers; bring a waterproof jacket. Carry a map and compass or offline GPS; don't rely solely on a phone. Tell someone your planned route and expected return time. Stay on marked paths; be careful on wet rock and muddy patches. Carry enough water and snacks; bring a small first aid kit. Be prepared for wind and cold at elevation and daylight hours; consider a headlamp if finishing near dusk. Mobile coverage may be limited on open moorland; have a plan for emergencies. Turn back if visibility drops or weather deteriorates.",
