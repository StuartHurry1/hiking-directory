    "summary": "Bittern Line Walk 7 is a challenging 18.7 km hike in the UK, following public rights of way along the historic Bittern Line corridor. The route combines long flat stretches, marshy sections, and rural farmland, with exposed ground in places. It’s best tackled as a full-day trek for a hard-rated route, and weather can switch quickly in the countryside.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed surfaces including gravel tracks, grassy field paths, and some paved sections; occasional boardwalks; short stiles and gates; potential mud after rain; largely flat to gently rolling with occasional gentle elevation.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day and check the forecast; stay on public rights of way and do not trespass on railway tracks or private property; be cautious of mud and uneven ground; wear sturdy footwear and consider trekking poles; carry water, snacks, and a basic first aid kit; keep a charged phone and a map or GPS; leave no trace; in remote sections, inform someone of your route and expected return time; rail safety: do not walk on or near active tracks—use designated crossings and paths, and give any rail infrastructure a wide berth.",
