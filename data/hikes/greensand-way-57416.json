    "summary": "The Greensand Way is a long-distance hiking route across Southeast England, following the Greensand Ridge for approximately 694 km in the UK. The route links remote countryside, historic towns and scenic viewpoints over chalk hills, woodlands, and farmland. It demands fitness and good navigation due to long distances between towns and varied terrain, but rewards hikers with classic English countryside scenery and a true sense of wilderness along a ridge that often offers sweeping views.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain includes chalk ridge downs, rolling farmland, woodlands, bridleways, and minor roads. Expect persistent ascents and descents, muddy tracks after rain, stiles and gates, and sections with limited waymarks in rural stretches. Footing can be uneven, with rocky or scree-like patches in upland sections and exposed ridgeline walking in windy conditions.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for variable UK weather and long stretches between resupply points; carry up-to-date maps and a compass as GPS may fail; wear sturdy footwear and carry appropriate clothing for mud, rain, and wind; check daylight hours and start early in winter; inform someone of your itinerary and expected finish times; respect private land and farm access; pack a basic first aid kit, water purification methods, whistle, and emergency shelter; be mindful of seasonal restrictions on camping and wild camping rules; ensure you have sufficient water and a means to rehydrate.",

    ],
    "best_seasons": "Spring to autumn (roughly March to October) generally offers the best weather and daylight for the Greensand Way. Summer can bring heat and crowds near towns; winter walking is possible but requires careful planning due to mud, cold temperatures, shorter days, and potential ice.",
