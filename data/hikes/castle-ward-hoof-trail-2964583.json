    "summary": "A challenging 23.3 km circuit along the Castle Ward Hoof Trail in the UK. The route demands stamina and good navigation, with long sections of exposed terrain, varied surfaces, and frequent elevation changes. Suitable for experienced hikers prepared for mud, weather shifts, and remote stretches.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of forest tracks, grassy moorland, stony paths, and rural lanes. The trail can be muddy and uneven, with short steep ascents and occasional exposed viewpoints. Navigation may be needed in less clearly marked sections, and some parts may have limited shelter from wind.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for long days and variable UK weather. Carry map and compass and know how to use them; don’t rely on GPS alone. Wear sturdy boots with ankle support and bring waterproof layers. Bring sufficient water and high-energy food; anticipate mud and rough ground. Be prepared for livestock, gate closures, and rural road crossings. Carry a whistle and a fully charged phone, and inform someone of your planned route and expected return time.",
