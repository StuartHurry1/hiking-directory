    "summary": "A challenging 19.2 km circuit around Wicken Fen, offering fenland scenery, boardwalks, and long flat stretches. The hike is demanding due to its distance and potentially muddy, waterlogged sections, so it suits experienced walkers prepared for variable conditions.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly flat fenland with extensive boardwalks over marshy areas, reeds, and seasonal wetland. Expect muddy paths, shallow water sections after rain, and occasional woodland trails. Elevation change is minimal, but the length makes it demanding.",
    "safety_notes": "Check local conditions and fen flooding before you go. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress for rain; stay on marked paths and be prepared for muddy, slippery sections. Carry a map and compass or GPS, bring sufficient water and snacks, and have a small first aid kit. Watch for ticks in grassy areas, insects in warm weather, and sudden weather changes. Inform someone of your plans and turn back if water levels rise.",
