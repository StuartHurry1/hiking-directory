    "summary": "The Holme Valley Circular Walk is a demanding long-distance loop in the UK, extending about 99.9 km. Designed for experienced trekkers, the route climbs and descends through countryside around the Holme Valley, weaving through fields, woodlands and villages. It rewards persistence with varied scenery but requires careful planning for multi-day trips.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a diverse mix of grassy moorland, hedged footpaths, stone trails, fields with gates and stiles, river and stream crossings, plus forest tracks. Surfaced sections can be muddy after rain and uneven underfoot. Significant elevation changes and exposure to wind make waterproof clothing and sturdy footwear essential. Navigation benefits from a map and compass; some parts may be poorly marked.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multiple days, or realistic long days with early starts. Always tell someone your route and expected return. Carry a detailed map, compass, and backup navigation device; have a fully charged phone as a backup. Pack enough water and high-energy food; know where to refill. Wear waterproof clothing, sturdy boots, and layers for temperature changes. Bring a basic first aid kit, emergency shelter, fire safety knowledge, and know local weather patterns and daylight hours. Be mindful of livestock, crops, and private land access rules; follow Leave No Trace.",
