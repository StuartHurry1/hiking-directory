    "safety_notes": "Check the weather forecast before you set out and be prepared for changing UK conditions. Wear sturdy boots and dress in layers with a waterproof outer layer. Stay on marked paths, watch for mud and livestock in fields, and take care crossing gates or stiles. Bring a map or GPS, but don't rely on phone signal in remote sections. Carry enough water and snacks, inform someone of your plan, and carry a small first aid kit and whistle. If walking with dogs, keep them under control and be mindful of other walkers and livestock. Shorter daylight in winter means plan accordingly.",
