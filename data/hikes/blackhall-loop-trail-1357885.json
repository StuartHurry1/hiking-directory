    "summary": "The Blackhall Loop Trail is a challenging 15.3 km circuit in the UK designed for experienced hikers. The route combines long ascents, varied terrain, and exposed sections, delivering rewarding views and a rigorous workout. Plan for a full day and solid navigation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed terrain: rough forest tracks, rocky and uneven ground, muddy stretches, and grassy moorland in places. Substantial elevation gain and potentially slippery footing in wet weather. Navigation can be tricky in dense sections; stay on the marked line and watch for cairns or markers.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard, long hike. Pack for changeable UK conditions and start early to ensure daylight. Wear sturdy, ankle‑support hiking boots and consider trekking poles. Bring a map and compass or GPS, plus a charged phone as backup. Carry enough water and high‑energy snacks for 5–7+ hours, plus a lightweight extra layer and waterproof shell. Inform someone of your planned route and expected return time. Stay on marked paths, be cautious on exposed rocky sections, and avoid risky crossings during wet or windy weather. In winter, be prepared for ice, shorter days, and harsher conditions.",
