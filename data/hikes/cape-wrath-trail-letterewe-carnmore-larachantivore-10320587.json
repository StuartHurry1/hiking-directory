    "summary": "The Cape Wrath Trail segment Letterewe–Carnmore–Larachantivore is a remote, hard-distance hike in northwest Scotland, covering about 53.6 km. It traverses rugged hills, peat bogs, and exposed coastal sections with long days, limited services, and variable weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rocky upland tracks, peat bogs, rivers, and exposed coast. The route combines remote moorland with cliff-top sections, often with few waypoints and challenging navigation. Weather can be wet and windy; footing can be rough and boggy, with tides affecting coastal portions.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a remote backcountry route with limited emergency support. Weather can be severe and change rapidly; dress in layers and be prepared for cold conditions even in summer. Navigation and map-reading skills are essential. Plan water and food carefully, monitor tide times if coastal sections are involved, carry a beacon or satellite messenger if possible, and let someone know your itinerary.",
