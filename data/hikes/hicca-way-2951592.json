    "summary": "Hicca Way is a demanding 49.7 km trek in the UK, designed as a multi-day hike through varied rural landscapes. With a hard difficulty rating, expect long days, significant elevation changes, and exposed sections. The route emphasizes endurance over technical rock scrambling, and is best tackled by experienced hikers with solid navigation skills.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail traverses a mix of muddy tracks, moorland, heath, woodland paths, and rural lanes. Surfaces can be uneven and wet, with occasional steep climbs and long ascents. Navigation relies on map and compass, and weather in the UK can change quickly, so plan for mud, rain, and wind.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan as a multi-day journey with a clear itinerary and check-in points. Carry a detailed map and compass (or trusted GPS) and know how to navigate in poor visibility. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours before starting; UK conditions can change rapidly. Pack sufficient food, water, and a warm, waterproof layer; bring emergency shelter and a first aid kit. Inform a friend or family of your plan and expected finish time; in remote sections consider hiking with a partner.",
