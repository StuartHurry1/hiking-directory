    "summary": "A coastal hike from Foula Pier to South Ness and Da Sneck covering about 12.1 km of rugged coast, moorland and remote shorelines. Rated moderate, the route delivers exposed cliffside sections, seabird habitats and remote scenery with limited facilities.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of stony coastal paths, grassy moorland, and uneven terrain with short climbs. Sections along cliff edges are exposed and can be slippery when wet; boggy patches and damp grass are common. Tracks may be rough and remote, with limited services and protection from weather.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a remote UK coastal route. Weather can change rapidly; wind, cold, rain and fog are common. Carry a map and compass even when using GPS, inform someone of your plan, and start early in daylight. Be wary of cliff edges, rising tides and slippery rocks. Mobile reception is often poor on Foula; bring a charged device and power bank, plus basic first aid and emergency gear.",
