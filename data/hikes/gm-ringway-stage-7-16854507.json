    "summary": "GM Ringway Stage 7 is a long-distance UK hike covering about 26.4 km with a hard difficulty. It traverses varied terrain and exposes hikers to weather changes, demanding good endurance and navigation skills.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed ground: grassy paths, wet boggy sections, rocky stretches, and occasional gates. Some sections may be exposed with open moorland; footing can be uneven and muddy, especially after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day (8–12 hours) and carry a detailed map and compass in addition to electronic navigation. Check the forecast; weather can change rapidly. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and warm, layered clothing; carry a waterproof shell. Stay on waymarked paths; be cautious on mud, bogs, and exposed ridges. Take care crossing gates and livestock areas; watch for rural roads. Carry enough water and food, plus a small first-aid kit, whistle, and a headlamp or torch with spare batteries. Let someone know your route and finish time; in remote sections, navigation aids may fail, so don't rely solely on GPS.",
