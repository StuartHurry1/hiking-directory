This moderate-length route follows a mix of quay paths, grassy dunes, and salt-marsh edges, offering sea views, wildlife, and a relaxed coastal atmosphere.

Stay on marked paths to protect wildlife and prevent erosion. Be aware of cyclists and other walkers on shared sections. Carry a map or GPS, a charged phone, enough water, and sun protection; bring a small first-aid kit. If walking with children or dogs, keep them under close control near water and crowds.",
