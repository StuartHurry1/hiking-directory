    "summary": "A challenging 117.8-km segment of the England Coast Path from Marsland Mouth to Newquay. This hard coastal trek blends rugged cliffs, sandy coves, and sweeping sea views with exposed headlands and long stretches between services. It rewards patient hikers with dramatic scenery but requires strong fitness, careful navigation, and thorough planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Rugged coastal terrain dominated by cliff tops, windswept headlands, shingle beaches, and patches of coastal moorland. Expect steep ascents and descents, uneven paths, and muddy sections after rain, with limited services between settlements. Tides and weather can affect routes, so stay on official paths and watch for unstable ground near cliff edges.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for remote coast: check weather and tide tables before each stage; wear sturdy boots and stay well back from cliff edges; carry a map, compass, and fully charged phone with offline backup; inform someone of your itinerary and expected finish; carry sufficient water and high-energy food; in an emergency call 999.",
