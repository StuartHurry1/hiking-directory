    "summary": "Dava Way is a challenging long-distance trail in the UK, approximately 97.1 km in length, following a former railway line and delivering varied scenery from rural landscapes to woodland and riverside sections. Its hard rating reflects the distance and exposure to weather changes.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily an old railway alignment converted for walkers, with long straight stretches and gentle grades. Surfaces range from compact gravel and surfaced paths to grassy tracks; expect mud after rain and occasional road crossings. The route can be exposed to wind and weather, making navigation and stamina important over multiple days.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multi-day travel with daylight and route planning. The distance makes this a demanding hike; carry a map and compass (or GPS), a charged phone, and a clear communication plan. Check weather forecasts before setting out; UK conditions can change rapidly. Wear durable boots, stay hydrated, and bring layers for rain and cold. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected finish times; know access points for escape or bailout if needed. Have backup lighting and an emergency plan for overnight stops.",
