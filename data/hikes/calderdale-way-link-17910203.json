    "summary": "A long-distance, hard 42.9 km hike designed as a link route for Calderdale Way. The route traverses varied terrain, including upland moorland, woodland, and river valleys, and demands good navigation and fitness from experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expected mixed terrain: grassy moorland, dirt and gravel paths, rocky sections, occasional road or village stretches, and muddy or boggy patches after rain. Significant elevation gains and descents with exposed sections on open moorland; navigation is important in fog or poor visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard route requiring preparation. Plan the full distance, check local weather and daylight hours, and carry map and compass. Notify someone of your plan. Wear sturdy boots and dress in layers; waterproofs are essential. Bring enough water and food, plus a way to signal for help. In winter, daylight is limited and conditions can be treacherous; consider a shorter alternative or sensible turnaround times.",
