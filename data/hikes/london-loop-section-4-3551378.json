    "summary": "A challenging 19.3 km segment of the London LOOP, a long-distance trail encircling Greater London. This Section 4 hike blends urban paths, woodland trails, and rural countryside with undulating terrain and several steep sections that test endurance.",

    "safety_notes": "Plan this as a long day out: check the weather, wear sturdy waterproof footwear, and bring a map and compass in addition to a charged phone. Tell someone your route and expected return time. Stay on marked paths, watch for busy road crossings, and be prepared for variable UK conditions, including rain and sudden changes in temperature. Carry sufficient water and snacks, and know where to shelter if necessary. In winter, daylight is limited; start early and consider backup options.",
