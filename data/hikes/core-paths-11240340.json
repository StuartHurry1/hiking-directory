    "summary": "Core Paths is a demanding long-distance trek in the United Kingdom, covering 647.2 km with a hard difficulty. The route threads through a mosaic of landscapes, from upland moor and forest to rugged coastline and tranquil rivers, offering remote scenery, historical routes, and frequent navigation challenges.",
    "terrain_summary": "The terrain is diverse: exposed moorlands and peat bogs with long grass and uneven footing; rocky coastal cliffs and sea-washed paths; dense woodlands; river valleys; farmland and rolling hills. Expect substantial elevation changes, isolated sections with limited services, and sections where waterproof kit and sturdy boots are essential. Navigation can be challenging in remote stretches, so reliable maps and compasses are recommended.",
    "safety_notes": "Core Paths traverses remote and variable UK terrain. Weather in the UK can change quickly, even in summer; plan for multi-season conditions and short daylight in winter. Always carry a detailed itinerary and a means to contact help; share your plan with someone and check-in when possible. Bring navigation tools (map, compass, and a GPS backup), a well-fitted backpack, and enough food and water for several days between resupply points. Have an emergency shelter, first aid kit, and a lightweight repair kit. Stay aware of wildlife, risk of slips on wet surfaces, and the potential for mobile coverage gaps. Know your limits and be prepared to bail out if weather or fatigue becomes unsafe.",
