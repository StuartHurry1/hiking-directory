    "summary": "The Cheshire Ring Canal Walk is a long distance circuit around the Cheshire Ring canal network in the North West of the UK, totaling about 299.1 km. It combines flat towpath walking along historic canals with lock sections, urban stretches and rural scenery. The route demands strong endurance, good navigation, and careful preparation for variable weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily flat canal towpaths with frequent surface changes. Expect smooth tarmac and packed earth, plus occasional gravel. You will encounter locks, gates and occasional road crossings. Sections may be exposed to the weather and can be muddy after rain; plan for both urban and rural terrain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan daily stage distances and weather conditions. Use a reliable map or GPS and stay on marked paths near water. Be mindful of canal edges, slippery surfaces and busy towpaths with cyclists. Ensure you have daylight hours for each stage and carry a means to contact someone in an emergency. Check local access rules, lock operations and accommodation options ahead of time. Keep hydrated, fed and dressed for cold or wet weather. Tell someone your route and expected finish times.",
