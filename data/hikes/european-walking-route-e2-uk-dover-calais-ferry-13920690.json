    "summary": "A hard coastal section of the European walking route E2 in the UK, spanning 49 km around the Dover area. The route includes a Channel ferry crossing from Dover to Calais, which is not walked. Expect exposed cliff paths, headlands, and variable tides; plan multi-day trekking with careful weather and ferry timing.",
    "terrain_summary": "Coastal terrain with clifftop paths, chalk cliffs, shingle beaches, and occasional road sections. Expect exposed winds, uneven footing, and possible slippery surfaces near the shore; navigation relies on maps and markers along the coast.",
    "safety_notes": "Check ferry schedules and book in advance for the Dover–Calais crossing; the Channel crossing is by ferry and not part of the hike. Monitor tide times, weather, and wind forecasts; coastal paths can be exposed and slippery, especially after rain. Wear sturdy footwear, carry a charged phone and map, and inform someone of your plan and expected return. In case of poor conditions, be prepared to shorten or pause the hike and seek shelter.",
