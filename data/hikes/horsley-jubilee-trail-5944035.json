    "summary": "The Horsley Jubilee Trail is a challenging 20.7 km hike in the United Kingdom, best suited for experienced walkers seeking a strenuous day on mixed countryside terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses a mix of rural lanes, field paths, and occasional grassy or stony sections. Expect uneven footing, hedgerows, and some short ascents and descents. Weather can make tracks muddy or slippery, especially after rain, so sturdy boots and a waterproof layer are advised.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day: carry a map and compass (and know how to use them), check local weather, and start with plenty of daylight. The trail runs through rural areas with variable mobile reception and can be exposed in places. Watch for livestock on byways, uneven ground, and potential boggy sections after rain. Carry sufficient water and snacks, a basic first aid kit, a whistle, and a light source if there is any chance of low light.",
