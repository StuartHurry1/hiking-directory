    "summary": "Clay Way is a demanding long-distance hike in the United Kingdom. Covering about 33.5 km with a hard difficulty rating, the route traverses varied terrain and offers a strenuous challenge for experienced walkers, suitable as a full-day epic or a multi-day trek with careful planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route features a mix of chalk and gravel paths, muddy forest tracks, grassy moorland, and occasional rocky or uneven sections. Expect significant elevation changes, steep ascents and descents, and gates or stiles to negotiate. Footing can be inconsistent and mud prone, especially after rain; navigation is generally straightforward on well-marked sections, but weather can reduce visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the weather and daylight hours before setting out; UK conditions can change quickly. Start early to ensure plenty of daylight. Carry a map and compass or a reliable GPS, and have a charged phone with offline maps. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers with a waterproof shell. Bring enough water and high-energy food, plus a basic first-aid kit and an emergency shelter or bivy. Inform someone of your plan and expected return time. Be prepared for boggy sections, river crossings, and variable terrain; if conditions are unsafe, turn back. Follow Leave No Trace principles.",
