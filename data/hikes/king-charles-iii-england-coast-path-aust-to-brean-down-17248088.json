    "summary": "A demanding long-distance coastal hike along the England Coast Path from Aust to Brean Down. At 111.6 km, the route combines rugged cliff-top trails, beaches and headlands between the Severn Estuary and the Somerset coast. Expect persistent exposure to wind, steep ascents and variable weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Coastal cliff paths with exposed ridges, grassy dunes, and occasional beach sections. Terrain is uneven and eroded in places, with steep descents and ascents between headlands. Weather can amplify hazards such as spray, rain and strong gusts; navigation is straightforward but use a map or GPS on remote sections.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for rapidly changing coastal weather, including strong winds and rain. Expect long sections with limited services and poor mobile reception; tell someone your route and timings. Stay well back from cliff edges, beware loose rocks and sea spray. Carry sufficient water, food, a reliable map/gps, and a lightweight emergency kit. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and layered clothing; check tide times if any sections require beach traverses.",
