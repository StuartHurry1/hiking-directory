    "summary": "Bollin Valley Way is a 74.9 km long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, rated hard. The route traverses varied countryside and river valley scenery with occasional road sections in an unknown region, offering a strenuous challenge for experienced hikers who are prepared for long days, changeable weather, and variable ground conditions.",

Bring waterproof clothing, warm layers, a first aid kit, and navigation tools (map and compass). Carry enough water and high-energy food, plus a means to purify water if needed. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected return. Keep to public rights of way and be mindful of livestock and private land.
