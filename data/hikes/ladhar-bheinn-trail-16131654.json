    "summary": "The Ladhar Bheinn Trail is a demanding 16.8 km hike in the UK that ascends rugged, exposed terrain to the summit of Ladhar Bheinn. It requires good fitness, solid navigation, and respect for rapidly changing mountain weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a remote mountain environment with rocky paths, scree, peat bogs, and occasional scrambling. The route features long ascents, exposed ridges, and potentially wet, slippery sections; prepare for uneven footing and variable conditions.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long, remote hike with rapidly changing weather typical of Scottish mountains. Check the forecast, start early, and allow 6–10 hours depending on conditions. Bring a map and compass (or a GPS device) and know the route, as cell reception is often poor. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and layered clothing; carry waterproofs, extra warm layers, and sun protection. Stay hydrated and carry sufficient food; bring a whistle and an emergency blanket or bivvy for emergencies. Inform someone of your plans and check in if possible. In winter conditions, this route becomes a mountaineering objective requiring specialist gear; avoid if storms or fog are forecast.",
