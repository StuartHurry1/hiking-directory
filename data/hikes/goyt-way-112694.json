    "summary": "Goyt Way is a strenuous 33.2 km long-distance hike in the United Kingdom. The route typically combines rural lanes, woodland paths, and open moorland, with varying elevation that demands solid stamina. Expect changeable UK weather, long daylight hours in season, and the need for good navigation on exposed sections.",
