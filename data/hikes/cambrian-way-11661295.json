    "summary": "The Cambrian Way is an ultra-challenging long-distance hike through diverse Welsh landscapes, totaling approximately 1499.4 km in this plan. It combines remote uplands, exposed ridges, moorland, river valleys, and changing weather, demanding strong endurance, solid navigation, and careful preparation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect rugged mountain ascents, rocky trails, peat bogs, and open moorland interspersed with forest tracks and occasional road sections. Much of the route traverses remote countryside with limited shelter, so good map skills and planned pacing are essential.",
    "safety_notes": "Conditions in upland UK can change rapidly. Carry reliable navigation tools (map and compass, with GPS as backup), inform someone of your route and daily plan, and have an emergency shelter. Prepare for long stretches with limited water sources and potential weather closures. Monitor fatigue, plan for cold or wet conditions even in summer, and be prepared for extended exposure in high sections.",
    "recommended_gear": [
      "Sturdy, well-fitting hiking boots with ankle support",
      "Waterproof and windproof shell jacket and pants",
      "Breathable base layers and mid-layers",
      "Backpack with 40–60 liters capacity and rain cover",
      "Lightweight tent or bivvy sack for emergencies",

    ],
    "best_seasons": "Late spring to early autumn (roughly May–September) is generally best for the Cambrian Way, offering longer daylight and more stable trail conditions. Be prepared for cold or wet conditions even in summer, and occasional snow at higher elevations.",
