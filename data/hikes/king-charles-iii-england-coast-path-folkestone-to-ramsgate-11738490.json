    "summary": "A demanding long-distance coastal trek along the Kent coast on the England Coast Path, linking Folkestone to Ramsgate. The 113.7 km route traverses cliff-tops, chalk escarpments, beaches and rural lanes, with seawinds and changing tides. Rated hard, it’s best broken into stages with careful planning, maps, and adequate time to rest in coastal towns along the way.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied mix of exposed cliff-top paths, chalk sea cliffs, shingle beaches, and occasional road and field sections. The terrain can be uneven, with steep ascents and descents, slippery surfaces after rain, and strong coastal winds. Some stretches follow narrow ledges above the sea; path conditions and accessibility may vary with seasons and erosion.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times and warnings for any beach or low-tide routes. The route runs along exposed coastal headlands and cliff tops with drop-offs; weather can change rapidly, bringing cold winds, rain, or sea spray. Bring a detailed map or GPS, a charged phone, and a means of communication; carry sufficient water and snacks; inform someone of your plans and expected finish times. Have appropriate footwear, dress in layers, and be prepared for limited services in remote sections; consider breaking into shorter day segments if conditions are poor.",
