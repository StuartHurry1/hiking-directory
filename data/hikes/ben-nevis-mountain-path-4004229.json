    "summary": "Ben Nevis Mountain Path, also known as the Mountain Track, is a strenuous 17 km round trip to the summit of Britain's highest peak. The route climbs from Glen Nevis through rocky terrain to high exposed ridges, with steadily increasing elevation and rapidly changing weather conditions. Fitness and preparation are essential for this challenging day hike.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail starts on a well-used path from Glen Nevis, progressing through rocky ground, scree slopes, boulder fields and occasional ladder sections. Expect exposed sections at higher elevations, loose stones, and long, steep ascents. Total ascent is around 1,300-1,350 m, with winds and cold temperatures possible even in summer.",
    "safety_notes": "- Weather on Ben Nevis can change quickly; storms, low visibility, and strong winds are common. Check a detailed forecast and be prepared to turn back if conditions deteriorate. - Stay on the marked path; loose scree and wet rock can be hazardous. - The hike involves significant elevation gain and exposure; ensure you have the fitness and experience for a hard day. - Daylight hours are important; start early in longer days and allow ample time to descend before dark. - Tell someone your planned route and timings; carry a map, compass or GPS, and have a charged phone as a backup. - Bring sufficient warmth, waterproofs, food and water; carry an extra layer and emergency shelter. - Be cautious near the summit; altitude can cause hypothermia, dizziness, or fatigue.",
