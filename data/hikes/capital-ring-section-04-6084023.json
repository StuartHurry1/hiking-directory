    "summary": "Capital Ring (Section 04) is a challenging 15.4 km segment of the Capital Ring circular walk in the United Kingdom. This hard-rated route combines urban streets, canal or river paths, and short woodland sections, with several ascents and gates along the way.",
    "terrain_summary": "The terrain mixes paved urban paths, compact gravel and dirt trails, grassy sections, and occasional stairs. Expect uneven ground after rain and some gates or stiles. There are occasional short rises, but the overall distance makes this a steady, demanding hike rather than a trivial ramble.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a full day and check the weather before you go. Carry a map or offline navigation app, a charged phone, and a backup power source. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and dress in layers; bring a waterproof jacket. Stay hydrated, pack energy snacks, and keep to established paths—watch for urban crossings, cyclists, and other pedestrians. Let someone know your plan and estimated return time in case of delays, and carry a basic first-aid kit and a whistle for emergencies.",
