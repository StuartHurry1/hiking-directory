    "summary": "Bronte Way is a hard long-distance hike in the United Kingdom totaling 182.5 km. The route traverses a mix of countryside, moorland, and small towns with cultural connections to the Brontë sisters. Expect sustained climbs, exposed sections, and multiple days of trekking that require careful planning and endurance.",
