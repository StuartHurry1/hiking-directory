    "summary": "Aislabie Walk is a challenging long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, covering about 50.9 km of varied countryside. Designed for experienced walkers, it typically unfolds over 2-3 days depending on pace and stops. The route traverses mixed terrain and requires good navigation, stamina, and contingency planning for weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route features diverse terrain common to UK long-distance trails: grassy uplands, muddy field paths, woodland tracks, stone slabs, occasional road or farm track segments, and several stiles and gates. Expect uneven surfaces, slope sections, and potentially boggy ground after rain. Scenic viewpoints and hedgerows provide seasonally changing scenery with exposure on high ground.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for changeable weather and limited daylight. Carry a detailed map and compass (or a reliable GPS), and have a navigation plan. Tell someone your itinerary and expected return. Start early and allow extra time for difficult sections. Wear sturdy, waterproof boots and layered clothing; bring a waterproof jacket and warm layers. Pack sufficient water and high-energy food, a first aid kit, a basic shelter or emergency bivvy, and a headlamp with spare batteries. A trekking pole can help on uneven ground. Keep a personal locator or emergency contact device if possible; be aware mobile signal may be patchy.",
