    "summary": "Chattenden Woods Walk is a challenging 15.6 km woodland hike in the UK. The route traverses mixed forest, with rolling terrain, several steeper sections, and exposed paths. Expect muddy footing after rain and seasonal changes in scenery as the forest shifts through the year. The hike rewards with dense woodlands, occasional clearings, and potential wildlife sightings.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain combines soft woodland tracks, compact gravel, uneven roots, muddy patches, and short steep ascents. Sections can be slippery when wet. Navigation is generally straightforward on established paths, but the distance and varied surfaces demand good fitness and sturdy footwear.",
    "safety_notes": "Distance is 15.6 km; allow 4–6 hours depending on pace. Wear sturdy hiking boots and weather-appropriate layers; weather in the UK can change rapidly. Muddy and uneven surfaces, loose stones, and some steep sections require careful footing. Carry water, snacks, a map or offline GPS, and a charged phone. Mobile reception can be patchy in wooded areas. Be aware of ticks and brambles; check yourself after the walk. Let someone know your plan and expected return time; consider shorter alternatives in poor conditions.",
