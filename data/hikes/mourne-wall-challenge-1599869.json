    "summary": "Mourne Wall Challenge is a demanding long-distance hike that follows the historic Mourne Wall around the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland. The route is about 59.4 km with significant elevation and variable weather, requiring good endurance and solid navigation. This guide covers terrain, safety notes, gear, and the best time to go.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect rocky granite paths, sections along the Mourne Wall, steep ascents and descents, peat bog and open moorland, heather, and occasional river crossings. The terrain is exposed and can be slippery when wet; fog or wind can reduce visibility. Navigation is important as you cross remote stretches.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in the Mournes can change quickly. Always check a reliable forecast before starting and be prepared for cold, wind, rain, and mist at any time. The route has remote sections with limited mobile signal, so tell someone your plan and estimated finish time. Start early to ensure daylight for the return. Carry sufficient food, water, and a means to call for help. If fatigue or bad weather set in, turn back. Carry a first aid kit and know basic wilderness first aid. Stay hydrated, watch for signs of hypothermia, and avoid solo attempts if you are not experienced.",
