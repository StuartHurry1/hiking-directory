    "summary": "Centenary Way is a demanding 251-kilometre long-distance trail in the United Kingdom, designed for experienced hikers. It traverses varied landscapes and offers a true endurance challenge with long days, remote sections, and limited services.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines coastal sections, rural lanes, moorland plateaus, woodlands, and uphill moorland bogs. Expect uneven surfaces, stiles, occasional rocky ascents, and potentially wet and muddy ground after rain. Distances between resupply points can be long, so plan ahead.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan in advance: navigation skills with map and compass are essential; don’t rely solely on GPS. UK weather can change rapidly, so pack waterproofs and insulating layers. Start early to maximise daylight and carry enough food and water for long days. Some sections are remote with limited mobile signal; tell someone your itinerary and expected timings and have a plan for emergencies. Wear sturdy boots and watch for boggy ground and exposed ridges. Be prepared for stream crossings after rain and always practice Leave No Trace.",
