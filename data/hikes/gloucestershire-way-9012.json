    "summary": "The Gloucestershire Way is a challenging long-distance trail that circles the county of Gloucestershire in the United Kingdom. At around 402.9 km, the route covers a diverse mix of rolling farmland, quiet woodlands, and historic market towns, with several steep sections that test endurance and navigation. The hike rewards perseverance with varied scenery, tranquil countryside, and a strong sense of rural England.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied terrain that includes grassy bridleways, muddy footpaths, rocky stiles, hedged lanes, and occasional road crossings. The route traverses rolling hills and upland edges, passes through woodlands and pastures, and features both exposed and sheltered sections depending on the season. While waymarkers are common, remote stretches can be harder to follow after adverse weather, so navigation skills are important.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for changeable UK weather; check forecasts and be prepared for rain, wind, or heat. Wear sturdy, waterproof boots and dress in layers. Carry a map and compass (or a reliable GPS) and know how to use them; don't rely solely on electronic devices. Tell someone your route and expected timings, and carry a charged mobile phone with a power bank. Stay hydrated and carry high-energy snacks; bring a first-aid kit and blister care. Be cautious at road crossings and around livestock; some sections have limited shelter and can be exposed in bad weather. In remote areas, be mindful of limited mobile signal and have an emergency plan.",
