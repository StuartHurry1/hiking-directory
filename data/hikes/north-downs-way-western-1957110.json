    "summary": "The North Downs Way (Western) is a 25.3 km hard hike in the UK that traverses rolling chalk downs and rural scenery. It weaves through farmland, grassy paths, and occasional woodlands, with exposed ridgelines and elevation changes that contribute to its challenging profile.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect chalk downland, grassy bridleways, packed farm lanes, and sporadic woodland. Footing is usually firm on clear days but can be muddy and uneven after rain. Some sections are exposed with wide views along ridges; there may be steep ascents and descents in places, demanding good footwear and steady navigation.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, hard hike with potential for quickly changing UK weather. Check forecasts, carry appropriate layers, and protect yourself from sun and rain. Navigation aids (map/compass or GPS) are recommended; stay on official paths as some routes run along private land. Inform someone of your plan and expected finish time. Stay hydrated, carry energy snacks, and have a plan for emergencies; daylight hours vary by season.",
