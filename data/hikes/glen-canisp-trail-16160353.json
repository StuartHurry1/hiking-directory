    "summary": "Glen Canisp Trail is a challenging 44.6 km route in the UK that tests endurance with varied Highlands terrain. It suits experienced hikers comfortable with long distances, significant elevation, and remote sections where weather can change quickly.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses rugged Highland terrain: open moorland, rocky climbs, peat bogs, and intermittent scree. Expect uneven footing, potential wet sections, and exposed sections with expansive views; navigation skills are important in mist or poor visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, remote hike. Check the forecast and daylight hours before setting out. Carry a map and compass (GPS as a backup) and know how to use them. Inform someone of your plan and expected finish time. Bring sufficient food and water, with a means to purify water. Have a warm, waterproof layer and a light emergency shelter. Carry a first-aid kit, whistle, and a charged phone as a backup; be prepared for rapid weather changes; consider staggering the route over two days if you’re not confident in completing it in a single day. In remote sections, there may be weak navigation markers and river crossings; turn back if conditions deteriorate.",
