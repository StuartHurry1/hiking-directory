    "summary": "Heritage 100 - Seaham to Nose's Point is a 6.7 km coastal hike along the Heritage Coast route in the northeast of England. The walk combines coastal path, occasional paved sections, and rocky shoreline with sweeping sea views toward Nose's Point. Rated moderate due to uneven ground and exposure to wind, it suits walkers with moderate fitness and good footwear.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mix of coastal cliff-top paths, shingle and rocky sections, and occasional paved segments. Expect uneven ground, loose gravel, and exposed stretches with sea spray and strong coastal winds. Elevation changes are gentle but may include short climbs and descents along the coast.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the weather forecast and sea conditions before starting; coastal winds can be strong and sudden. Stay on marked paths and away from cliff edges; some sections have unstable ground near the edge. Wear sturdy boots and carry a waterproof layer. Bring enough water and snacks, tell someone your plan, and have a charged phone and a map. In case of emergency dial 999. Be mindful of tides if approaching shoreline sections; dusk hikes can reduce visibility.",
