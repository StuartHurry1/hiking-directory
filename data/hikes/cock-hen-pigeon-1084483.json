    "summary": "A demanding 29.7 km hike in the United Kingdom, named Cock, Hen and Pigeon. The route is classified as hard and requires a high level of fitness, navigation skill, and preparation for long day lengths and varied terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of grassy slopes, rocky outcrops, boggy moorland, and farm tracks. Sections can be exposed with occasional steep ascents and descents, and navigation may be challenging in poor visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan and share your route before starting; carry a map and compass and know how to use them; check weather forecasts as UK conditions change quickly. Start early to maximize daylight; pace yourself and take regular breaks. Carry sufficient water (2–3 liters) and high-energy snacks; bring a light layer and a waterproof jacket. Wear sturdy, waterproof boots with good ankle support; carry a first aid kit, a whistle, and a charged phone with a power bank. Stay on marked paths, be cautious of boggy ground and exposed sections, and be mindful of cattle on rural stretches. In poor visibility, turn back or seek shelter before conditions worsen.",
