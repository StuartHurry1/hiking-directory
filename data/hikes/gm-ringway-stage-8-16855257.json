    "summary": "GM Ringway Stage 8 is a hard 33.1 km trek in the UK, built as Stage 8 of the GM Ringway network. It is a long, demanding day requiring good stamina, navigation, and careful planning for a full-day hike. Terrain and conditions can vary, and weather can change quickly in the UK, so preparation and pacing are essential.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route features varied UK countryside terrain: well-used trails, grassy field margins, muddy sections after rain, occasional rocky or stony patches, hedged fields with gates or stiles, and occasional minor road crossings. Expect uneven footing, potential mud, and some exposed or uphill sections. Navigation may rely on map/GPS and waymarked paths; follow markers and be prepared for navigation changes in unknown regions.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, hard hike. Ensure suitable fitness and prior long-distance trekking experience. Check weather and daylight hours, start early, and plan rest stops. Carry enough water and high-energy food for a full day. Wear sturdy boots and dress in layers with a waterproof/windproof outer shell. Bring a map, compass or GPS and know how to use them; carry a charged phone and offline maps as a backup. Pack a basic first aid kit, emergency whistle, headlamp, extra batteries, and an emergency layer or bivy. Be prepared for mud, rain, and rapid weather changes; stay on marked paths; mind road crossings and livestock; inform someone of your route and expected return; if conditions worsen, turn back.",
