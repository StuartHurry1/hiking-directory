    "summary": "Allerton Country Walk is a challenging 33.6 km hike in the United Kingdom. The route traverses a mix of rural farmland, woodlands, and country lanes, with sections of uneven footing and gentle to moderate elevation gain. Designed for experienced hikers, it rewards with varied scenery and a sustained long-distance workout.",

Be prepared for livestock fields, gates, and stiles; take care crossing roads and watch for other trail users. Inform someone of your route and expected return time, and carry identification and a whistle for emergencies.",
