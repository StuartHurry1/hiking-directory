    "summary": "A challenging 26.6 km circuit-style hike in the UK characterized by steep ascents, rugged terrain, and dramatic scenery. It requires good fitness, navigation, and weather preparation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rocky paths, tussocky moorland, uneven scree, and occasional stream crossings. The route includes steep ascents and descents, exposed sections, and ground that can be loose or wet. Navigation is important, as weather can reduce visibility and obscure features.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for rapidly changing weather and short daylight hours. The area is remote with limited mobile reception in places. Start early, carry a detailed map and compass, and know how to use them. Wear sturdy boots and carry waterproof and warm layers. Bring ample water and high-energy food, plus a first aid kit, whistle, and emergency shelter. Hike with a partner or group when possible and inform someone of your itinerary. In winter, avalanche, ice, and severe wind risks increase; check local conditions before proceeding.",
