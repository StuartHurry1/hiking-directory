    "summary": "The Kidlington Circular Walk is a challenging 17.5 km circuit in the UK. Expect varied terrain including canal towpaths, fields, and woodland tracks, with several gates and occasional gentle ascents. It’s a long day out that rewards persistence with countryside views and a satisfying finish back at the start.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route blends flat canal paths with more uneven countryside sections. Be prepared for mud after rain; footing can be uneven on fields and woodlands, and some stretches may require careful footing and navigation.",
    "safety_notes": "Start early and allow a full day to complete. Check weather forecasts, wear appropriate clothing, and stay on marked paths. Bring a map or GPS, water, snacks, and a basic first aid kit. Watch for livestock on farmland, gates, and potential mud; inform someone of your plan and expected return time; know how to contact local emergency services if needed.",
