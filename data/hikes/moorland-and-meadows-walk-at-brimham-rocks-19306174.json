    "summary": "A 12.6 km circular hike through moorland, meadows and dramatic limestone outcrops at Brimham Rocks in the United Kingdom. The route offers open, exposed scenery with mixed terrain and a moderate difficulty suitable for walkers with some experience.",
    "terrain_summary": "The walk combines open moorland paths and grassy meadows with sections of rocky, uneven ground around Brimham Rocks. Expect a mix of smooth trail, loose stones, steps on rock faces, and occasional gentle climbs. Conditions can be exposed and weather-driven, with boggy patches after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather on moorland can change rapidly—bring appropriate layers and waterproofs. Wear sturdy boots with good grip, stay on marked paths, and watch for uneven rocks, loose stones, and boggy patches. Carry a map or GPS, enough water, snacks, and a basic first aid kit. Let someone know your route and expected turnaround time; be mindful of ticks in heather and wildlife; in low light or winter conditions, allow extra time.",
