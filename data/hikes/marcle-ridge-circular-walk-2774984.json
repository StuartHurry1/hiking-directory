    "summary": "The Marcle Ridge Circular Walk is an 8.8 km circular ridge hike in the UK designed for walkers with a moderate level of fitness. The route follows a raised grassy crest with exposed sections, offering wide views, rolling fields, and occasional woodland. Expect a mix of pasture tracks, hedges, and stiles as you traverse the ridge and return to the start point.",
    "terrain_summary": "A ridge route with grassy, uneven footing along exposed crestlines. Expect some rocky or compacted soil sections, stiles or gates, field paths, and occasional woodland. The weather can affect footing and visibility, so mud, wind, and damp conditions are common, especially after rain. Wear sturdy boots and be prepared for a change in conditions.",
    "safety_notes": "Ridge walking can be exposed to wind and changing weather. Check the forecast before you go and avoid the route in severe conditions. Stay on marked paths, mind cliff edges and gates, and watch for livestock. Mobile coverage may be patchy in rural areas; tell someone your planned route and ETA. Carry a map and compass or GPS, sufficient water and snacks, weather-appropriate clothing, and a small first aid kit.",
