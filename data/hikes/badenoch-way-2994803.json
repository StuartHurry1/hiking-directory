    "summary": "A demanding long-distance trek in the UK, Badenoch Way covers 42.7 km of varied terrain. Expect significant elevation changes, remote sections, and rugged paths; suitable for experienced hikers seeking a hard challenge.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed terrain: some well-maintained paths, grassy moorlands, rocky sections and occasional boggy ground. Elevation gain is variable with long ascents and descents; weather can be harsh and muddy conditions are common after rain. Navigation may be challenging in remote stretches with limited waypoints.",
    "safety_notes": "Prepare for rapid weather changes common in the UK. Carry a map and compass and use them in addition to technology; do not rely on a phone as your sole navigation tool. Tell someone your plan and expected return time. Start early to ensure daylight; winter days are short. Pack appropriate clothing, including waterproof layers, and carry an emergency shelter. Bring enough water and high-energy food, and consider a water purification method. Include a basic first aid kit, a whistle, and a headlamp with spare batteries. Trekking poles can help with stability on uneven ground.",
