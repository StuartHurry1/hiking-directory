    "summary": "A demanding circular coastal hike of 24.8 km starting at Morston Quay, looping via Cockthorpe and Blakeney back to Morston Quay. The route delivers expansive sea views, salt marshes, and glimpses of inland lakes and wetlands, with a mix of marsh paths, dunes, farm lanes and coastal footpaths.",
    "terrain_summary": "The hike combines tidal estuary edges, salt-marsh boardwalks, dune tracks, quiet lanes and some surfaced roads. Surfaces range from compacted dirt and wooden boardwalks to soft mud and loose sand; long sections exposed to wind make it physically demanding. Be mindful of tides near the coast and check local access restrictions in Blakeney and Morston areas.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day with exposed coastal weather. Check tide times and weather forecasts; some marsh sections may flood at high tide. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers; bring a map or GPS and a charged phone. Carry ample water and high-energy snacks, a first aid kit, sun protection, a whistle, and spare socks. Inform someone of your route and expected return. Respect wildlife and farm privacy at inland sections; follow signed paths and beware road crossings.",
