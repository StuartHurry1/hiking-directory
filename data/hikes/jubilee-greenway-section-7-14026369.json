    "summary": "Jubilee Greenway Section 7 is a hard 21.9 km stretch of the UK's Jubilee Greenway, blending urban walking with parkland and canal towpaths. This section tests stamina with long distances and a mix of surfaces, frequent road-crossings, and diverse cityscape scenery. It suits fit hikers who are comfortable navigating urban routes and can plan around transit options for gaps.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly paved city streets and park paths, with segments of canal towpaths, compact gravel trails, and occasional grassy verges. Elevation is generally light but can include gentle climbs and steps; surface quality varies with weather, and muddy patches are possible after rain. Expect frequent crossings, bridges, and sections where navigation is important.",
    "safety_notes": "Urban-hike safety: stay aware of traffic at crossings, keep to sidewalks where required, and follow temporary signs. Plan for daylight hours and weather changes; water, food, and a charged phone are essential. Canals and busy routes may be crowded; watch your footing near crowds and against moving traffic. Have a backup plan for transport in case of closure or fatigue. In remote gaps, identify nearby access points and emergency contact options.",
