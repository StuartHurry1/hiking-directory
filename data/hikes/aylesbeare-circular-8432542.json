The route blends farmland, hedgerows, woodland edges and occasional country lanes, offering gentle elevation and pleasant viewpoints along the way.

Keep dogs under control or on a lead where required. Bring a map or GPS, water and snacks; carry a charged phone and a basic first-aid kit. Be mindful of mud and slippery surfaces after rain and watch for thorny undergrowth and low branches.",
