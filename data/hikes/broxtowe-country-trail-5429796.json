    "summary": "Broxtowe Country Trail is a hard, long-distance hike in the UK totaling 102.6 km. The route traverses an unknown region and combines rural farmland, woodlands, hedged lanes, and intermittent road sections.

Stay on established paths; be prepared for limited mobile reception in rural areas. Carry navigation tools (map and compass) even if using GPS.
