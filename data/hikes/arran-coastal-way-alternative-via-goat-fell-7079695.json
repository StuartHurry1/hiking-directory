    "summary": "An 11 km coastal variant of the Arran Coastal Way that follows exposed shoreline on the Isle of Arran, with an optional ascent of Goat Fell. Moderate difficulty suited to hikers with good stamina and comfortable footwear; rewards include sea views, rugged cliffs, and potential wildlife.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily coastal path with rocky shoreline, grassy headlands, and occasional woodland sections. Expect uneven, wet, and wind-swept terrain; some steep climbs when diverting to Goat Fell, and footing can be loose near cliffs. Tide can affect beach segments and may limit access at high water.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in coastal Scotland can change rapidly; always check the forecast and tide tables. The route has exposed sections and can be windy, with slippery rocks when wet. Wear sturdy waterproof boots, layer clothing, and carry waterproofs. Bring a map and compass (or GPS), sufficient water and snacks, a first aid kit, and a headlamp. Mobile reception can be unreliable; don’t rely on phone navigation. If attempting Goat Fell, be prepared for a steep, rocky ascent; consider turning back if conditions worsen.",
