    "summary": "The Millennium Trail is a challenging long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, spanning 104.5 km with a hard difficulty rating. It demands solid stamina, efficient pacing, and careful planning, as terrain and weather can vary significantly along the route. Suitable for experienced hikers who are comfortable with multi-day trekking and navigation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Hikers can expect a varied mix of moorland paths, forest trails, rocky tracks, grassy downs, and occasional road sections. Elevations may be substantial, with exposed sections where wind and rain are common. Terrain can be slippery when wet, and navigation may be difficult in featureless landscapes; water sources may be scarce in some stretches, so plan for water and purification.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, strenuous trek across potentially remote countryside. Plan your itinerary and lodging (or camping) in advance. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours; UK weather can change rapidly. Carry a detailed map and compass (and/or a GPS device) and know how to use them. Inform someone of your route and timing. Stay hydrated and fueled, pace yourself to avoid fatigue, and inspect footwear and feet daily to prevent blisters. Pack a basic first aid kit, a whistle, a space blanket, and emergency contact information. In emergencies, call 999 and report your location. Be mindful of wildlife and seasonal hazards, especially on exposed moorland.",
