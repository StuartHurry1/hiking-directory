    "summary": "A 15.5 km loop that combines Hatfield Forest's woodland trails with a stretch along the Flitch Way. Rated hard due to distance and mixed terrain, with lakeside sections, gradual ascents, and uneven paths challenging for experienced hikers.",

Carry enough water and snacks, a map or GPS, and a fully charged phone; mobile signal may be weak in parts of the forest.
