    "summary": "Inver Path is a 12.9 km moderate hike in the UK that winds through a mix of woodland tracks, open grassy areas, and occasional rocky sections. It offers a steady pace with an undulating profile, suitable for hikers with some experience and a reasonable level of fitness. Plan for roughly 3–4 hours, depending on pace and conditions.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines well-marked forest paths, grassy fields, and intermittent rocky or muddy segments. Elevation change is moderate, with surface quality varying with weather. Expect some boggy patches after rain; waterproof footwear and adaptable layering are advised.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the weather forecast and daylight hours before setting out. Wear sturdy, waterproof boots and dress in layers to cope with UK conditions. Stay on marked trails, be cautious on muddy or rocky sections, and carry a map or GPS. Bring enough water and snacks, and inform someone of your planned route and expected return time. Mobile signal may be limited in remote parts, so navigation skills and a backup plan are important, especially in winter when daylight is shorter.",
