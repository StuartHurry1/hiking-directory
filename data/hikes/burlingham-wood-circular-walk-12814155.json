    "summary": "Burlingham Wood Circular Walk is a long and demanding woodland circuit in the UK. At about 27.9 km, this hard-rated route is best suited to experienced hikers with good navigation and endurance. Expect varied terrain across forest tracks, open clearings, and undulating sections as you loop back to the start.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily forest trails and woodland paths with mixed surfaces: compact dirt, roots, and potential mud in wet weather. Some short grass or gravel sections and occasional open clearings. Elevation varies, with gentle to moderate climbs and descents; expect uneven ground and occasional wet and slippery patches.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day and hydrate adequately. Check weather and daylight hours before starting. Carry a map and compass; do not rely solely on a phone GPS. Stay on waymarked routes and inform someone of your plan and expected return. Wear sturdy boots and dress in layers with waterproof outerwear. Bring snacks and water for the full hike, a first-aid kit, a charged phone, and a basic emergency whistle. Be prepared for muddy, uneven ground, brambles in overgrown sections, and varying visibility in woodlands. If hiking solo, consider a personal locator beacon or similar safety arrangement.",
