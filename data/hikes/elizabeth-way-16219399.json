    "summary": "Elizabeth Way is a challenging 15-kilometre hike in the UK that combines varied terrain, long distances, and potential elevation gain. The route traverses rural trails, fields, and occasional rocky sections, offering a rewarding day for experienced trekkers prepared for changeable weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail features a mix of grassy paths, rocky stiles, and boggy patches.
