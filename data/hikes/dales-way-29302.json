    "summary": "The Dales Way is a challenging long-distance trek across northern England, roughly 320 km in length, weaving from the doorstep of the Yorkshire Dales through wild river valleys toward the Lake District. It rewards trekkers with remote landscapes, dramatic scenery, and a demanding pace that tests stamina over multiple days.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of gently rolling dales, limestone paths, and persistent ascents: riverbanks, moorland heather, and occasional road and village sections. The trail alternates between smooth paths, rocky sections, and boggy stretches, with long gradual climbs and some steep ascents. Weather can change rapidly, making waterproof footwear and layered clothing essential.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multi day navigation in a remote environment: carry a map and compass (and know how to use them), have a planned itinerary and emergency contacts, book lodging or plan permitted wild camping, monitor weather forecasts, carry sufficient water and food, wear sturdy boots, avoid crossing flooded streams, and be prepared for limited phone reception in upland sections.",
