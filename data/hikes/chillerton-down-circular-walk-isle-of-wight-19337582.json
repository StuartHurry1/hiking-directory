Be aware of livestock in fields and use gates or stiles; keep dogs under control. Mobile signal may be patchy in rural parts. Watch for traffic at road crossings and respect private land boundaries. If conditions are poor (strong wind, heavy rain, icy paths), consider shortening or postponing the walk.",
