    "summary": "Macmillan Way West is a demanding long-distance footpath in the United Kingdom, spanning 636.1 km. Designed for experienced hikers, it traverses varied rural landscapes with rolling countryside, farmland, and intermittent road sections. Adequate planning, pacing, and gear are essential to complete the trek safely.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of quiet country lanes, farm tracks, woodlands, and occasional minor roads. Terrain ranges from firm, well-trodden paths to muddy fields and soft soil after rain. Elevation is rolling rather than steep, but long days and exposed stretches can add to the challenge. Navigation is straightforward where waymarked, but maps and compass skills are recommended for less-marked sections.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a multi-week to multi-month undertaking. Plan resupply points and overnight stops in advance. Check weather forecasts, as UK conditions can change rapidly. Wear sturdy footwear and bring blister care. Stay aware of road traffic at crossings and ensure high-visibility clothing in low light. Carry enough water and a means to purify or filter water on longer stretches. Carry a basic first-aid kit, a whistle, and a means to contact help; consider a personal locator beacon for remote sections. Let someone know your itinerary and check-in regularly.",
