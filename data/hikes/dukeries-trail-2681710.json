    "summary": "The Dukeries Trail is a challenging long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, covering about 129.7 km. Designed for experienced trekkers, the route presents a mix of upland moor, woodland trails, exposed open sections, and rural lanes, with significant cumulative elevation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied mix of grassy paths over rolling hills, peat bogs in upland zones, woodland tracks, country lanes, and occasional road crossings. Some sections are exposed in open moorland; path marking can be intermittent in remote stretches. Navigation and map-reading are essential.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, strenuous journey that may require multiple days or a very demanding single push. Plan thoroughly: know your daily distances and camping options, check weather forecasts, and carry appropriate clothing for sudden changes. Always carry a reliable map and compass (GPS as backup), and inform someone of your itinerary. Water sources can be scarce in some sections, so bring sufficient water and a means to treat it. Wear sturdy, waterproof boots and use trekking poles if helpful. Be prepared for boggy ground, steep ascents, gates/stiles, and variable UK weather; carry a first aid kit, emergency blanket, whistle, and a means of communication. Leave no trace and respect livestock and wildlife.",
