    "summary": "Longster Trail is a demanding 27.8 km hike in the UK, designed to test endurance and navigation. The route is classified as hard and runs through varied countryside in an unknown region, so thorough planning and sensible pacing are essential.",

Carry a map and compass (or GPS with a charged device), a fully charged phone as a backup, and a whistle for emergencies. Tell someone your planned route and ETA. Stay hydrated and fueled; pace yourself to avoid fatigue. Wear sturdy boots and layers; boots with good grip help on rocky or wet ground. Be mindful of changing weather and potential sensation of hypothermia or heat in exposed sections. Respect land access rules and leave-no-trace principles.",
