    "summary": "Eday Heritage Walk is a challenging 24.7 km circuit that blends coastal scenery, open farmland, and historic sites. With a hard difficulty rating, hikers should be prepared for long distances, varied terrain, and variable UK weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of coastal paths, grassy lanes, rocky tracks, and some road sections. Ground can be uneven, muddy after rain, and exposed in windy sections; hills or ridges may require sustained effort.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a full day and check local conditions. Carry a map and compass or GPS, and know how to use them. Bring enough water and food for the day and be prepared for sudden weather changes. Wear sturdy boots and weather-appropriate clothing; in the UK rain and wind are common even in summer. Keep devices charged but do not rely solely on them for navigation. Share your itinerary with someone and set a check-in plan. Be mindful of wildlife and livestock on rural trails. Watch for uneven ground, mud, and potential drop-offs near coastal edges. If coastal sections are involved, be aware of tides and local restrictions. If visibility is poor, consider postponing or turning back. Carry a lightweight emergency blanket or bivvy bag.",
