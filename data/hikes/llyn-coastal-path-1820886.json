    "summary": "The Llŷn Coastal Path is a demanding 311.1 km coastal traverse around the Llŷn Peninsula in Wales, UK. Expect long stretches of cliff-top paths, sandy beaches, tidal estuaries, and expansive sea views. The route crosses remote headlands and small coastal settlements, requiring good fitness, navigation, and preparedness for changeable weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly exposed coastal terrain with a mix of rugged cliff paths, rocky tracks, beach sections, and occasional farmland lanes. Surface quality ranges from firm tracks to eroded paths and soft sand; expect uneven footing, gusty winds, and sections where careful footing is needed near cliff edges. Tidal conditions can affect parts of the route, so plan beach crossings around tides.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide tables and weather forecasts before beach or estuary crossings. The coast is exposed and weather can change rapidly—layer your clothing, bring a waterproof shell and a warm layer, and wear sturdy, grippy boots. Many sections are remote with limited mobile coverage; carry a charged phone, a power bank, and a map/compass. Plan accommodation or campsites ahead and tell someone your route and expected timings. Carry enough water and high-energy food for longer stretches, and consider a light first aid kit and blister care. In emergencies, use a whistle and know local emergency numbers; be prepared to alter plans if seas, storms, or waves make sections unsafe.",
