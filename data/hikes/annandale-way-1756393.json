    "summary": "Annandale Way is a demanding long-distance trail in the UK, spanning approximately 331 km. Hikers should expect remote countryside, varied terrain, and multiple days of trekking with substantial elevation and limited town access.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route crosses river valleys, open moorland, rolling hills, and woodland sections. Expect a mix of well-trodden paths and rough tracks, with exposure on high ground and potential for slippery surfaces after rain; navigation may be required across open terrain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multi-day trips with a clear itinerary and inform someone of your route. UK weather can be unpredictable, so be prepared for rapid changes, rain, and cold conditions even in summer. Carry a map and compass or GPS, a reliable light, sufficient food and water, and a means to treat water. Use proper layering, protect against wind and rain, and be mindful of river crossings after heavy rainfall. Respect local access rules and Leave No Trace principles.",
