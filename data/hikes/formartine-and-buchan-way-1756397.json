    "summary": "A demanding long-distance trail in northeast Scotland, the Formartine and Buchan Way covers roughly 208.4 km of varied terrain. The route traverses quiet rural lanes, farmland, woodland, peat heath, and coastal paths, offering exposed sections and long days of walking. Designed for experienced hikers with good navigation and endurance, the hike rewards with remote scenery, villages for resupply, and a true sense of solitude.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of firm gravel and quiet country lanes, short stretches of woodland, open moor/peat bog in places, farm tracks, and coastal segments. Elevation is generally gradual but there are some sustained long sections without shade or shelter. Weather can be highly variable; mud is common after rain, and wind is frequent along coastlines.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for long distances between services; signposting is generally good but a map/compass is essential. Weather in northeast Scotland can change rapidly; layer for warmth and rain, and protect against wind. Some remote stretches have limited phone reception; carry a charged device, a light emergency kit, and a planned route with check-ins. Ensure adequate daylight for daily targets and consider shorter day stages in winter.",

    ],
    "best_seasons": "Spring through autumn (roughly April to October) offer the best weather and daylight in northeast Scotland. Early autumn brings crisp, clear days, while late spring may be wet; winter hikes are more challenging with reduced daylight and harsher conditions.",
