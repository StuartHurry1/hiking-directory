Wear sturdy walking boots, dress in layers with a waterproof outer shell, and carry enough water and snacks. Stay on marked paths, tell someone your route and expected return time, and be cautious on exposed sections and slippery rocks; wildlife and livestock may be present in rural sections. Mobile reception may be limited in remote stretches.",
