    "summary": "A challenging 15.2 km circuit around Higher Penrose and the Parkland Walk in the UK. The route combines exposed moorland with shaded woodland and parkland, featuring long ascents, uneven footing, and occasional wet sections. It is best tackled by experienced hikers with solid navigation and fitness, and weather can change rapidly in this part of the countryside.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain includes rocky tracks, peat bogs, muddy paths, grassy moorland, forest floor, and some stile crossings. Expect long climbs, uneven footing, and occasional wet and slippery sections, with variable visibility in mist or rain. Some exposed stretches offer distant views but require sure footing.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for variable UK weather and shorter daylight in winter. Carry a map and compass and know the route; do not rely solely on a phone. Wear sturdy boots and warm, layered clothing; waterproofs are essential. Watch for boggy patches and loose rocks, especially after rain. Start early in shorter daylight months, tell someone your route and expected return, and consider a companion for this hard hike. Keep dogs on lead where required and be mindful of livestock and other walkers on shared paths.",
