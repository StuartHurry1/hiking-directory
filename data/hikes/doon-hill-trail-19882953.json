    "summary": "Doon Hill Trail is an 8.1 km moderate hike in the UK, offering rolling countryside, grassy tracks, and a summit viewpoint at Doon Hill. The route is suitable for walkers with some experience and solid footwear, and it can be enjoyed in most seasons with appropriate gear.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route uses a mix of grassy paths, short rocky or uneven sections, and woodland tracks. Expect gentle to moderate elevation gain, occasional mud in wet conditions, and exposed areas with wide views from open sections. Footing can be uneven, so sturdy boots are recommended.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the weather before you go and wear sturdy, waterproof footwear. Stay on marked paths and watch for uneven ground and exposed edges. Bring a map and compass or a GPS device since phone signal may be limited. Tell someone your planned route and expected return time. Carry extra layers, water, and snacks. Avoid hiking alone in poor visibility or high winds and turn back if weather deteriorates.",
