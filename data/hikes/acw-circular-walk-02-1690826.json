    "summary": "ACW Circular Walk 02 is a strenuous 21.4 km circular hike in the UK, designed for experienced walkers seeking a challenging day out with varied terrain and elevation.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route features a mix of muddy field paths, grassy bridleways, gravel tracks, and sections of woodland. Expect uneven surfaces, short ascents, and occasional rocky or nettle patches. Some road crossings and open exposed segments mean weather can strongly affect footing and visibility. Navigation is generally straightforward but can be tricky in poor visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard, long-distance hike. Check forecast and daylight hours; start early while days are long. Carry enough water and food, and know your turnaround time. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers; weather can change quickly in the UK. Bring navigation tools (map and compass or GPS), a fully charged phone, and a trusted route description. Inform someone of your plans, and be prepared for mud, fatigue, and occasional isolated sections. In severe weather or injury, turn back and seek shelter if needed. Stay on public rights of way and observe local access rules.",
