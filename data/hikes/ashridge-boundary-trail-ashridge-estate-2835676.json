    "summary": "A challenging 66.6 km ridge-focused hike around Ashridge Estate in the UK, combining long ridgelines, woodland paths and rolling hills. Designed for experienced hikers, this hard route demands endurance, solid navigation and good weather planning to enjoy dramatic viewpoints and varied terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly exposed ridges with uneven, grassy tracks and occasional rocky sections. Expect a mix of gravel paths, chalk trails, and forested segments. Elevation gain is substantial, and conditions can be variable and slippery when wet. Views from ridge crests are rewarding, but navigation is important in open sections.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for variable UK weather and limited daylight on longer legs; carry enough food and water; tell someone your route and timings; navigation skills are essential as the course includes ridge sections with potentially poor wayfinding in dense cover. Wear sturdy boots and use trekking poles if needed. Phone signal may be unreliable in remote stretches. In case of injury or severe weather, descend to the nearest trailhead and seek local assistance.",
