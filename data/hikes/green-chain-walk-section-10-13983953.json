    "summary": "A 12.1 km stretch of the Green Chain Walk (Section 10) in the United Kingdom. The route blends urban green spaces with open countryside, offering a steady moderate pace, varied surfaces, and occasional gentle ascents. The scenery shifts from parkland and streets to fields and woodlands, with coastal glimpses possible depending on the exact alignment.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of surfaces: tarmac or cycle paths in towns, compact gravel and well-trodden tracks in parks, grassy lanes, and some muddy sections after rain. The route includes gentle climbs and descents, gates and stiles, and short road crossings. Footing can be uneven where fields meet the path.",
    "safety_notes": "Check weather and sea conditions if coastal sections are involved. Wear sturdy footwear with good grip and bring a waterproof layer. Carry a map or offline navigation app, a charged phone, and a small first aid kit. Stay on marked paths, be mindful of other walkers and cyclists on shared routes, and plan for daylight hours; in winter, daylight is short. Let someone know your plan and estimated return time; carry emergency numbers (999 in the UK).",
