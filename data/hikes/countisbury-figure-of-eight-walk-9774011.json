    "safety_notes": "Safety notes: Weather in the UK can change rapidly; check forecasts and start early. Wear sturdy, waterproof footwear and dress in layers. Stay on marked paths, be careful near cliff edges and watch for high winds or sudden spray in coastal sections. Mobile reception can be patchy in remote parts—carry a map and compass or a GPS device. Bring enough water and snacks, a small first aid kit, and a whistle. Inform someone of your plan and expected return time. After rain, paths can be very muddy and slippery; take care on exposed rock or roots.",
