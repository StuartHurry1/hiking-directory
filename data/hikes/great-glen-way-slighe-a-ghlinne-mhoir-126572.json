    "summary": "An epic, hard-distance hike along the Great Glen Way, known in Gaelic as Slighe a' Ghlinne Mhòir. The route covers approximately 378.1 km in the UK, threading from Fort William toward Inverness through highland landscapes, lochs, and Caledonian Canal corridors. Expect long days, challenging terrain, and spectacular Scottish scenery.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed terrain including canal towpaths along the Caledonian Canal, forest tracks, peat bogs, rocky ascents, and lochside trails. Long sections can be muddy after rain; navigation is straightforward on the official route but weather and visibility can change quickly in the Highlands. Some stretches involve exposure with open viewpoints.",
    "safety_notes": "Very long-distance hike in remote Scottish countryside. Plan for 15–25+ days at a steady pace (roughly 15–25 km per day, depending on fitness and conditions). Check the weather forecast and daylight hours; Scottish weather can change rapidly. Carry waterproof, windproof gear, warm layers, and sturdy footwear. Use maps and a compass or a GPS device; stay on marked paths. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected timelines. Be prepared for river or stream crossings after rain and for boggy sections. Adhere to the Scottish Outdoor Access Code and practice Leave No Trace; plan camping options in advance and respect landowners and habitats. Have a plan for emergency communication and know local emergency numbers.",
