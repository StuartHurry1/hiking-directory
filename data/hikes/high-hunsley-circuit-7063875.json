    "summary": "The High Hunsley Circuit is a demanding long-distance hike in the UK, covering roughly 76.8 km on varied rural terrain. The route combines farmland, hedgerows, woodland, and minor roads, with elevation changes and several exposed sections. It’s best tackled by experienced hikers who can navigate, pace themselves, and plan multi-day trips with proper safety in mind.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of well-marked footpaths, grassy tracks, muddy field margins, hedgerows, and occasional woodland. The terrain can be uneven with gentle to steep climbs, stony sections, and occasional marshy patches. Navigation may be challenging in low visibility and on long, remote stretches.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a multi day trek with proper pacing and regular checks on weather forecasts. Tell someone your route and expected finish. Carry a map and compass or GPS, a charged phone, and a backup power bank. Bring sufficient water and food, a first aid kit, and a means to stay warm and dry. Check for itineraries and permission requirements on paths. Be prepared for changing UK conditions and limited mobile signal in remote sections.",
