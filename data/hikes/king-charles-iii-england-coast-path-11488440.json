    "summary": "The King Charles III England Coast Path is a demanding long-distance coastal hike in the United Kingdom, totaling about 271.4 km along the England Coast Path. It traverses rugged cliffs, sandy coves and exposed headlands with frequently changing weather, making multi-day planning essential.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily coastal trail with cliff-line paths, surf-washed sections, mud, rocky slabs and occasional beaches. Expect exposed ridges, uneven footing, and variable terrain that can be slippery when wet. Navigation is important in remote sections; tides and sea spray can affect portions of the route.",
    "safety_notes": "Distance and isolation: the route is long and may require multi-day trekking with long stretches between towns. Plan for weather variability, strong coastal winds, and rapidly changing conditions. Check tide times for any low-lying sections, carry a detailed map and a GPS device, and inform someone of your plan. Wear sturdy boots with good grip, stay back from cliff edges, and have emergency gear and a contingency plan.",
