    "summary": "Northwood Trail is a 12.4 km moderate hike in the UK that traverses a mix of woodland paths and open terrain. The route offers steady elevation gains, scenic forest scenery, and potential muddy sections in wet weather. It's suitable for hikers with some experience and a good level of fitness, with options for shorter detours if needed.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily well-marked woodland and gravel paths with gentle to moderate climbs. Expect some muddy patches after rain and a few exposed roots or rocky steps. The surface ranges from compact earth to grassy tracks and light gravel; footwear with solid grip is recommended.",
