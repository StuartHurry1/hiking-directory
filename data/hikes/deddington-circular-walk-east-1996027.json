    "summary": "A challenging 18.2 km circular hike starting and finishing near Deddington East, UK. The route traverses rural lanes, fields, and wood margins, with varied terrain and several ascent sections, making it suitable for experienced walkers with good navigation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily rural paths and farm tracks with a mix of grassy field edges, mud, and occasional tarmac. Expect uneven footing, stiles, short ascents, and possible boggy sections after rain. Navigation is straightforward on rights of way, though hedgerows can obscure markers in places.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in the UK can change quickly; check forecasts before setting out. Wear sturdy boots with good grip and bring waterproof clothing. Stay on public rights of way, watch for livestock, and have a map or GPS and a charged phone. Carry sufficient water and energy snacks, and plan the timing to avoid being on exposed paths after dark. Let someone know your route and expected return. In winter, daylight is limited and paths may be icy or very muddy; reconsider if conditions are poor.",
