    "summary": "A short, easy 4.7 km walk along the Friends of the Peak District Boundary Walk route in the UK. Suitable for beginners and families, it offers gentle countryside scenery with mostly flat or mildly undulating terrain and minimal elevation gain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly country footpaths and fields with grass, compacted dirt, and occasional gravel. Expect gates and stiles, some uneven sections, and potential muddy patches after rain. Some sections may run alongside hedgerows or light roads; watch for livestock and cyclists on shared paths.",
    "safety_notes": "Even short walks in the UK can be affected by weather and uneven ground: check the forecast before you go, wear sturdy footwear, and bring a windproof or waterproof layer. Stay on marked paths, observe gates and livestock, and close gates behind you. Carry a map or offline navigation, a charged phone, water, and a small snack. Let someone know your plan and expected return time. In exposed countryside, navigation and visibility can be challenging; avoid walking after dark and seek shelter if sudden weather arrives.",
