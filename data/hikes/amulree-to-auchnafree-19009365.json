    "summary": "The Amulree to Auchnafree hike is a 19.5 km challenging route through rural Perthshire in the UK. The path combines rolling moorland, woodland tracks and steep ascents, offering remote scenery and a sense of solitude. It is physically demanding and requires good navigation, preparation and fitness.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed terrain: gravel and grassy tracks, peat bogs, and forest paths with uneven footing. Elevation gain includes steep climbs and exposed sections; weather can be variable, so be prepared for wind, rain and sun exposure. Some segments may be boggy or waterlogged, especially after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for 5–7 hours of hiking. Check weather and daylight hours; in poor conditions the route can become dangerous. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and layered clothing; carry a map, compass and GPS as signal may be unreliable. Stay on marked paths, watch for boggy ground and uneven rocks, and be prepared for navigation challenges. Tell someone your plan, carry a fully charged phone (but don't rely on coverage), bring sufficient water and food, a first aid kit and emergency shelter or light insulation. In the UK, dial 999/112 for emergencies.",
