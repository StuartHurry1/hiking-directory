    "summary": "Mersey Way is a long-distance hike in the UK covering 78.1 km at a hard difficulty. The route is typically undertaken over multiple days and traverses a mix of countryside, riverside paths, and occasional built-up sections, demanding solid fitness, navigation, and preparation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect varied terrain: riverbank paths along parts of the Mersey, country lanes, wooded sections, rough moorland, and occasional urban approaches. Trails can be muddy after rain, and some sections may have uneven footing or short climbs.",

Carry a detailed map and compass (GPS as backup), a charged phone, and a means to signal for help. Tell someone your route and expected finish. Stay hydrated, pace yourself, and be prepared for both sun and cold. Be mindful of potential hazards such as muddy tracks, livestock, and sections shared with cyclists or other hikers.",
