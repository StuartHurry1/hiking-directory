    "summary": "The Lancashire Coastal Way is a hard, long-distance coastal trek in the UK, totaling 170.1 km along the Lancashire coastline. It combines sea views, beaches, cliffs, and promenades, demanding good fitness, navigation, and preparation for variable coastal weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route blends flat promenades, sandy beaches, rocky beach sections, grassy cliff-top paths, and occasional road or town walking. Expect exposed coastal conditions, mud, uneven surfaces, and possible erosion or rockfalls. Navigation can be straightforward in towns but challenging in remote stretches with tide-influenced crossings.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times before crossing exposed beaches or estuaries; some segments depend on tidal conditions. Weather in the northwest can change rapidly, so carry waterproofs and warm layers. Wear sturdy, waterproof footwear and be prepared for mud and slippery surfaces. Stay on designated paths near cliffs to avoid unstable edges and rockfalls. Have a map or GPS, a means to re-supply, and inform someone of your itinerary; carry a charged phone and emergency whistle. Plan for shorter daylight hours in winter and have a plan for emergency shelters or accommodation if needed.",
