    "summary": "An arduous 175.2 km coastal trek along the historic Coast to Coast route, from Richmond to Robin Hood's Bay. The path traverses rolling dales, wooded valleys, moorland, river crossings, and dramatic sea cliffs, demanding stamina and solid navigation across northern England.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly rural uplands and coastal paths: river valleys, moorland plateaus, limestone escarpments, and long stretches of exposed coastline. Expect steep ascents and long days; footing varies from grassy tracks to rocky, uneven surfaces; weather can shift quickly.",
    "safety_notes": "Hard route demands good fitness and navigation. Check weather forecasts; coastal exposure can bring wind, rain, and fog. Some sections have limited mobile reception; carry a map and compass. Plan overnight stops and food/water supplies; water sources may be scarce in upland stretches. Wear sturdy boots and use trekking poles if needed for stability. Pack extra layers, a headlamp, and an emergency blanket. Inform someone of your itinerary and timings. Respect coastal erosion and cliff-edge dangers, especially in high winds or rough seas.",
