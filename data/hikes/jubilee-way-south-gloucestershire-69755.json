    "summary": "Jubilee Way is a challenging long-distance footpath in the UK, spanning 47.8 km. Classified as hard, the route traverses rural countryside around South Gloucestershire with variable elevations, multi-surface paths, and some road sections. Effective planning, solid fitness, and reliable navigation are essential to complete the hike safely.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed terrain including hedged country lanes, field paths, woodlands, and muddy sections. There are gentle to moderate ascents and descents, with some exposed segments and limited shade. Surface quality can vary with weather, so waterproof footwear and layered clothing are recommended.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a multi-day hike due to the distance. Share your route and expected return time with someone. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours before starting. Carry a map and compass and know how to use them; stay on marked paths and be cautious at road crossings. Bring sufficient water and food, a first aid kit, and a means of signaling for emergencies. Mobile signal may be weak in rural sections; follow Leave No Trace and respect property boundaries.",
