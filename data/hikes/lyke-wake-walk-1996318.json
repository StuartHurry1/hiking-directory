    "summary": "The Lyke Wake Walk is a demanding long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, listed here as 194.3 km and rated hard. This multi-day trek traverses varied countryside with moorland, farm tracks, and coastal sections, requiring solid navigation, planning, and endurance.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a diverse mix of terrain: exposed moorland on upland stretches, rough tracks, farm lanes, and occasional coastal paths. Elevation changes can be significant, with boggy ground and uneven surfaces that demand sturdy footwear and careful map reading. Navigation may be challenging in poor visibility or remote sections.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multiple days with achievable daily distances. Carry a reliable map and compass or GPS and know how to use them. Check local weather before starting; UK moorland weather can change rapidly. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring waterproofs and warm layers. Stay hydrated and well fueled; carry sufficient water and high energy snacks, and consider a method for water purification. Pack a basic first aid kit and blister care items, a whistle, and a lightweight emergency shelter. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected finish time. Be prepared for boggy sections and occasional crossings with appropriate clothing and footwear. In remote areas, consider a signaling device or phone with emergency contacts.",
