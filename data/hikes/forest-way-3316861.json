    "summary": "Forest Way is a challenging long-distance hike in the UK, spanning 133.5 km through forested terrain. The route is classified hard and typically takes about 6-9 days to complete at a steady pace. The trail offers immersive woodland scenery but weather and terrain can be demanding, so proper preparation is essential.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly forest trails with mixed surfaces: well-defined paths, rooty sections, damp and muddy ground, occasional gentle ascents and descents. Expect uneven footing, potential boggy stretches, and limited open views in dense forest sections. Navigation is important in unknown regions.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in the UK can change rapidly even in summer. Plan for rain, cold, and wind; carry waterproofs, warm layers, and eye protection. Bring reliable navigation (map and compass or GPS) and a charged device. Tell someone your itinerary and expected finish time; consider a GPS tracking device. Stay on official trails, monitor trail conditions, and be prepared for limited cell service in forests. For a 133.5 km trek, pace yourself, take regular breaks, and know emergency contacts. Hydration and nutrition should be planned; daily mileage should be adjusted to conditions. Know your limits; if conditions deteriorate, be prepared to rest or cut the hike short and seek nearby resupply points.",
