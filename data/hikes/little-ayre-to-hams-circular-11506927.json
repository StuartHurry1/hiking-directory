    "summary": "A demanding 24.7 km circular hike from Little Ayre to Hams in the UK. Expect long distances, exposed upland sections, and a mix of rocky paths, heather moorland, and boggy terrain. Strong fitness and solid navigation are essential for this challenging route.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly upland moorland with long, uneven stony sections, peat bogs, and heather. Ground can be soft and wet in places; footing may be slippery after rain. The route involves ascents and descents and may be exposed to wind and sudden weather changes, making navigation and stamina important.",
    "safety_notes": "Check weather and daylight conditions before departure; UK uplands can change rapidly. Carry a map and compass and know how to use them; GPS is helpful but not a substitute. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and layered clothing; bring a waterproof outer layer. Bring sufficient water and high-energy food; some parts may be remote. Inform someone of your plan and expected return time; avoid hiking alone in poor conditions. Be cautious of boggy ground and loose or uneven footing; stay on established paths when possible. Consider season and daylight when planning; winter conditions require extra precautions and equipment.",
