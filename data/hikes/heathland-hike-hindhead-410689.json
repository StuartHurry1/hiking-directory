    "summary": "A 14.1 km moderate trail near Hindhead, UK, weaving through open heathland and patches of woodland. The route offers expansive views, gentle climbs, and opportunities to observe heathland flora and wildlife.",
    "terrain_summary": "The hike alternates open heathland with sandy, well-defined paths and several short woodland sections. Expect uneven ground, exposed sections with limited shade, and occasional gentle ascents toward surrounding ridgelines.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in the UK can change quickly; bring a waterproof layer. Wear sturdy, grippy footwear suitable for uneven, sandy, and potentially muddy surfaces. Stay on marked paths; some sections may be exposed on ridgelines—carry sun protection and a hat. Check for any trail closures around Hindhead and the Devil's Punch Bowl; navigation is straightforward but a map and compass or GPS are recommended. Be mindful of livestock and dogs; gates and stiles may require careful footing. Carry sufficient water and snacks, as facilities are limited along the route. Let someone know your plan and estimated return time; keep your phone charged. If visibility is poor or conditions are muddy, consider postponing the hike.",
