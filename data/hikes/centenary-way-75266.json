    "summary": "Centenary Way is a demanding long-distance hike in the UK, spanning approximately 844.2 km. The route traverses diverse landscapes—from urban paths and rural bridleways to open moorland and river crossings—requiring solid navigation, stamina, and careful planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "The hike covers a wide range of surfaces: paved streets and gravel tracks in towns, country lanes, farm tracks, heather moorland, woodlands, river crossings, and occasional coastal or hill sections. Elevation gain accumulates over many days, with steep ascents and long descents in places.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for long days and variable daylight. Some sections run through remote countryside with limited phone signal, so carry a detailed map, compass, and a GPS device with spare batteries. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected timings. Bring ample food and water, know your limits, monitor weather forecasts, and be prepared for sudden changes in conditions.",
