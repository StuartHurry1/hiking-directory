    "summary": "Ben Ledi Trail is a demanding 19.1 km hike in the UK that rewards strong climbers with expansive views from the summit. The route involves a steady, steep ascent and rocky, uneven ground, so it is best tackled by experienced hikers who are prepared for changing weather and long, challenging traverses. Plan for several hours, start early, and be ready for a strenuous day.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail combines forest tracks, steep rocky climbs, and exposed ridges. Expect steep ascents, loose scree near the summit, mud after rain, and uneven footing with roots and stones. Navigation is straightforward on clear days, but mist or wind can reduce visibility, so proper gear and caution are essential.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in the UK can change rapidly; bring appropriate clothing and waterproof layers, sturdy boots, and a fully charged phone. Stay on marked paths, carry a map and compass or GPS, and tell someone your route and expected return. Watch for fatigue, wind exposure near the summit, and loose rocks; if conditions worsen or visibility is poor, consider turning back.",
