    "summary": "A hard 18.3 km hike in the UK that links the iconic Grey Mare's Tail waterfall with Loch Skeen. The route blends long, exposed ascents with rough, rocky paths and loose scree, delivering spectacular highland scenery. It demands good fitness, navigation, and proper gear, and weather can be highly variable.",
    "terrain_summary": "From the car park you face long climbs over rough tracks and moorland, followed by steep rocky sections and loose scree as you near Loch Skeen. The upper sections are exposed with uneven footing, boulder fields, and damp ground near the loch. Conditions can be windy with rapidly changing visibility; mud, wet rocks, and occasional scrambling are common features.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for changeable Scottish mountain weather: check forecasts, carry a map and compass (and GPS as backup), and tell someone your route and timings. Wear sturdy boots and layers, bring waterproofs, food, water, and a basic first aid kit. Stay on marked paths where possible, avoid cliff edges and loose scree, start early to ensure daylight, and be prepared to turn back in adverse conditions or if fatigue sets in.",
