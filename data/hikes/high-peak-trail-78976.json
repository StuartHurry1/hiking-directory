    "summary": "The High Peak Trail is a hard, long-distance hike in the UK, covering about 118 km in an area with an unknown region designation. The route demands endurance, solid navigation, and weather resilience across varied terrain and remote sections. This overview provides terrain context, safety notes, gear recommendations, and seasonal guidance for this demanding trek.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of exposed upland moorland, rocky tracks, muddy forest paths, and occasional road sections. The route involves sustained climbs and descents, uneven footing, and potentially boggy ground after rain. Navigation can be challenging in open country; carry a map and compass even on a well marked route. UK weather is highly variable, so plan for wind, rain, and bright sun on open sections.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for rapid weather changes common in the UK. Carry map and compass and know how to use them. Start early to maximize daylight, especially in winter. Tell someone your itinerary and estimated finish time. Bring enough water and food and monitor fatigue. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and layered clothing. Carry a lightweight emergency shelter, a whistle, and a first aid kit. In remote sections consider hiking with a companion or check in at regular points.",
