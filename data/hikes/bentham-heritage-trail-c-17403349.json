    "summary": "Bentham Heritage Trail C is a challenging 15.7 km hike in the UK, designed for experienced walkers. The route blends rural tracks, fields, and occasional road sections, with steady elevation that adds to the difficulty. Expect scenic views, historic hedgerows, and variable terrain as you traverse countryside landscapes.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail uses undulating countryside terrain: gravel and dirt paths, grassy verges, and some tarmacked stretches. Footing can be uneven with exposed roots or stones; mud is common after rain. Weather and visibility affect navigation, and there are occasional open ridges where wind can be strong. Waymarking is present but map reading is advisable in sections.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, strenuous outing. Plan for a full day, check weather forecasts, and start early in winter months. Wear sturdy boots with good grip, dress in layers, and carry waterproofs. Bring sufficient water and high-energy snacks, a map and compass or GPS, a fully charged phone, a first aid kit, a whistle, and sun protection. Inform someone of your route and expected return time. Watch for livestock and farm gates, and be prepared for limited signal in remote sections.",
