    "summary": "A challenging 20.6 km segment of the Great Glen Way in the UK. This hard-rated trek traverses varied Highland terrain, including forest tracks, rocky sections, and exposed moorland, with potential boggy patches and elevation gain. It rewards experienced hikers with remote scenery, loch views, and a sense of rugged wilderness.",
    "terrain_summary": "Dual terrain: woodland paths, open moor, and rocky ground. Expect uneven footing, tree roots, and occasional water crossings. Some sections are exposed to winds; navigation is straightforward along the route, but weather can reduce visibility and trail conditions can be muddy after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day: 6–9 hours depending on pace and conditions. Weather in the UK Highlands can change rapidly, with wind, rain, and cold even in summer. Always carry a map and compass as primary navigation, and use a GPS as backup. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring extra layers, a hat, and gloves. Tell someone your plan and expected return. Carry enough water and high-energy snacks; know your resupply points. Be prepared for boggy patches and potential trail erosion; avoid travel in poor visibility or severe weather, and consider a buddy system for safety.",
