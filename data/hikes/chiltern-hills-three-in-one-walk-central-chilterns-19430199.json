    "summary": "Chiltern Hills Three-in-One walk, Central Chilterns is a hard, long-distance circuit in the UK that combines three routes into a single 39.7 km trek across chalk downland, woodlands and farmland, featuring several steep ascents and exposed sections.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses chalk downland along the Chiltern escarpment, with a mix of grassy ridges, woodland trails, hedgerows and farmland. Expect uneven footing, stiles and gates, and varying surfaces including rocky and muddy stretches. The terrain includes long climbs and descents and can be exposed in places; weather and footing may change with the seasons.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan as a long day or split the hike into two stages. Check the forecast, as UK weather can shift quickly. Wear sturdy footwear and dress in layered, weather-appropriate clothing. Bring ample water (2–3 L) and high-energy foods. Carry a map and compass or GPS, and know how to use them; mobile signal may be patchy. Start early to ensure daylight and carry a headlamp as a backup. Stay on marked paths; watch for stiles and gates. Be mindful of exposure on ridges and ticks in woodland; use sun protection and insect repellent. Inform someone of your route and expected return time.",
