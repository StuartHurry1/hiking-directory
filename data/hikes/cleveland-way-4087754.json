    "summary": "The Cleveland Way is a challenging long-distance trail in the United Kingdom, stretching 208.1 km across varied landscapes. Hikers should be prepared for remote sections, significant elevation, and changing weather as they traverse upland moors, forests, and coastal cliffs.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of grassy moorland and rugged uplands, limestone pavements, forest tracks, coastal cliffs, and occasional road sections. The route combines sustained ascents and long ridgelines with exposed sections and long descents.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in the UK is highly changeable; plan for all conditions. The trail includes remote moorland and coast where services are sparse—carry maps and a compass and know how to navigate. Wear sturdy boots and bring insulating layers plus waterproofs. Monitor tide times for coastal sections and carry sun protection. Ensure adequate water and a method to purify it, and have a plan for accommodation or camping. Inform someone of your itinerary, start early to maximize daylight, and be prepared for fatigue on long days. Be mindful of fatigue, navigation errors, and weather-related hazards.",
