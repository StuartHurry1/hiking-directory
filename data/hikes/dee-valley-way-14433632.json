    "summary": "Dee Valley Way is a challenging 36.5 km long-distance hike in the UK, tracing the River Dee through a mix of wooded valleys, pasture and open countryside with varied terrain and occasional river crossings.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route features a mix of surfaces: riverbank paths, woodland trails, grassy lanes, and uneven rocky sections. Expect mud after rain, steep ascents and descents, exposed ridges with open views, and occasional short road links. The scenery ranges from lush valley floors to rugged upland corners, with wildlife along the Dee valley.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard hike with long distances and potentially remote sections. Plan for 1-2 days or a very early start if completing in one long day. Check weather and daylight hours; UK conditions can change rapidly. Carry a detailed map and compass (don’t rely on phone GPS), a fully charged phone, and a backup power bank. Wear sturdy waterproof boots, bring waterproof clothing, and carry sufficient food and water. Be prepared for muddy sections, river crossings with rising water, and navigation challenges in less well-marked areas. Inform someone of your plans and expected return; watch for exposure, ticks, and changing trail conditions. If in doubt, turn back and seek local guidance.",
