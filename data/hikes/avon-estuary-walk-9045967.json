    "summary": "An arduous 34.4 km coastal estuary hike in the UK called the Avon Estuary Walk. The route follows tidal estuary edges with a mix of flat boardwalks, muddy shoreline, gravel tracks and rural lanes. Expect variable weather, exposed winds, and long sections in sun or shade; overall duration and effort classify it as a hard outing.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed coastal terrain: estuary boardwalks, tidal mudflats (check tide times to avoid flooded sections), gravel paths, farm tracks and some paved sections. Sections can be soft or slippery when wet; expect uneven surfaces and occasional gate crossings. Long, exposed stretches with minimal shade.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan around tide times and weather; check local tide tables for mudflat crossings and potential flooding. The route is long and strenuous; ensure you are physically prepared and carry sufficient food and water. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and dress in layers; bring waterproofs for rain and wind. Use a map, compass or GPS, and keep a charged phone; share your plan with someone. Stay on marked paths, respect private property, and watch for traffic on rural roads. Daylight can be limited in winter; carry a light and whistle for emergencies.",
