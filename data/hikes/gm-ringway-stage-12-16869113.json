    "summary": "GM Ringway Stage 12 is a demanding 42.6 km stretch of the GM Ringway route in the UK. This hard stage blends long day-hike effort with varied terrain, including moorland, woodlands, and occasional road crossings. It rewards endurance with steady climbs, exposed sections, and distant views, and is best tackled by experienced hikers with solid navigation and weather preparedness. Plan for a long day and consider overnight options if needed.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of stony tracks, grassy moorland, muddy paths, and occasional pasture crossings. The route may include rough ascents, exposed ridges, and secluded stretches with limited amenities. Navigation can be challenging in fog or low light, and UK weather can change quickly, so be prepared for variable conditions and footing.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for long daylight hours and potential rapid weather changes. Carry a detailed map and compass; do not rely solely on a phone. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers with a waterproof outer shell. Bring enough water and high-energy food; have a means to purify additional water if needed. Share your itinerary with someone and carry an emergency contact method; in remote sections mobile reception may be limited. Include a whistle, basic first aid supplies, and an emergency shelter. Be cautious on exposed or uneven terrain and adjust pace to conditions and fatigue; have a bailout plan or transport options if needed.",
