    "summary": "An 82.2 km long-distance hike along the Basingstoke Canal in the UK. A challenging route that follows a historic waterway with varied scenery, from rural countryside to urban edges, featuring towpaths, locks and bridges. The overall difficulty is hard due to distance and mixed terrain.",

Footing can be slippery after rain or on wet boards.",

Check local notices for closures or restrictions before setting out.",
