    "summary": "A challenging long-distance hike along the historic Cross Borders Drove Road from West Linton to Traquair. Spanning approximately 78.5 km, the route traverses farmland, moorland, and remote drove road sections, demanding solid navigation, fitness, and preparation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily gravel and bridleway tracks with remote, exposed stretches. Mixed surfaces include farm lanes, moorland, occasional road crossings, and potential boggy patches. Elevation varies, featuring long climbs and descents; expect mud after rain. Navigation is important as the route isn’t always clearly signed.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard, long-distance route. Plan for multi-day trekking or long days on foot. Check weather and daylight hours; remote sections may have limited mobile signal. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and use layered clothing. Carry map and compass or GPS, a fully charged phone, water and high-energy food, and a basic first aid kit. Bring a lightweight emergency shelter, headlamp, and extra warm layers for exposure. Respect farmland and livestock; close gates behind you. Inform someone of your plan and expected return. If conditions are icy, foggy, or stormy, reconsider or shorten the route.",
