    "summary": "A strenuous long-distance hike tracing an Isle of Wight-focused alternative to the European long-distance path E9. At 181.4 km (about 113 miles), it traverses coastal cliff paths, chalk downs, woodlands, and rural lanes with regular elevation changes and exposed sections.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily coastal and upland terrain: cliff-top paths along the southern coast, chalk downs, hedged lanes, woodlands, and beach stretches. Expect frequent elevation changes, rugged sections, tidal crossings, and varying surface conditions from tarmac to grassy tracks.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather can change rapidly; cliff edges and erosion present hazards. Stay on marked paths, pay attention to tides on coastal sections, and carry a map and compass in addition to a GPS. Mobile signal may be patchy in rural areas. Plan for daylight hours, partner where possible, and arrange accommodations or overnighting in advance. Bring sufficient food and water and know your limits to avoid dehydration or exhaustion.",
