    "safety_notes": "Weather in UK uplands can change rapidly; check a current forecast before you go. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers. Stay on marked paths and be prepared for wind on the ridges. Bring a map and compass or GPS and know how to use them. Take sufficient water and high-energy snacks. Let someone know your route and expected return time. Carry a small first-aid kit and a whistle for emergencies. In winter or wet conditions the terrain can be more challenging and daylight is shorter; reconsider if conditions are poor.",
