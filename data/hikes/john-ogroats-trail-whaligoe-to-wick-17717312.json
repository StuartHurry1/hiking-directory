    "summary": "A challenging 31.6 km coastal hike along the John O'Groats Trail from Whaligoe to Wick in northern Scotland. The route follows rugged cliff paths, exposed beaches, and open moorland, offering dramatic sea views but demanding fitness, navigation, and weather preparedness. Plan for a long day (or split into two) with strong coastal winds and variable conditions.",
    "terrain_summary": "Rugged coastal footpaths, rocky shores, eroded tracks, sections along cliff edges, beach and moorland intervals. Expect uneven surfaces, steps, gate crossings, and occasional boggy patches. Weather and visibility can change quickly; stay on marked routes and use caution near cliff edges.",
    "safety_notes": "- Check weather and tidal conditions before starting. - The coast is exposed and can produce strong winds and spray; dress in layers and keep gear dry. - Navigation is essential: carry a map, compass, or GPS device in addition to a charged phone. - Daylight hours vary; plan accordingly and consider an early start or splitting into two days in shoulder seasons. - Wear sturdy waterproof boots with good grip; bring a weatherproof jacket and trousers. - Tell someone your route and expected return time; carry a whistle and a basic first aid kit. - Carry ample water and high-energy snacks; have a small emergency plan and a dry bag for valuables. - Be mindful of cliff edges and sensitive wildlife; leave-no-trace.",
