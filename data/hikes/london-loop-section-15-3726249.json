    "summary": "London LOOP Section 15 is a strenuous 22.2 km segment of the London LOOP in the UK. The route is a long day hike with mixed surfaces, elevation gains, and potential road sections, requiring solid navigation and fitness.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain varies from well kept footpaths and woodlands to chalk trails and rural lanes. Expect uneven ground, exposed roots, modest ascents and descents, stiles, gates, and muddy patches after rain. Some road sections may require careful footing and attention to traffic.",
    "safety_notes": "Check weather and daylight hours before starting. Carry a detailed map or GPS and know your route, as signal may be patchy in countryside sections. Inform someone of your plan and expected return. Pack enough food and water for a full day, and bring waterproofs and appropriate layers. Be mindful of weather changes, late departures, and mud. Stay on signed paths, watch for gates in farming areas, and give way to other walkers and cyclists on shared sections. In winter, reduced visibility and icy surfaces increase risk; adjust pace and timing accordingly.",
