    "summary": "The Macmillan Way is a challenging long-distance path in the United Kingdom, stretching about 1,074 km. The route traverses a mix of rural lanes, farmland, woodlands, and river valleys, with occasional urban stretches. It demands strong physical stamina and careful planning for multi-week journeys and offers varied scenery and cultural insights along the way.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect long days on undulating countryside, hedged lanes, fields, woodlands, and occasional moorland. The surface varies from compact tracks to grassy paths; some sections include stile crossings and gates. Navigation can be straightforward in built-up sections but may require map reading in remote rural tracts.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan each stage with realistic daily distances. Carry a map and compass (GPS as backup). Check weather forecasts and daylight hours. Inform someone of your itinerary. Be prepared for hit-or-miss phone signal in rural sections. Carry sufficient water, food, first-aid, and emergency shelter. Watch for livestock, road crossings, and seasonal closures. In remote areas, consider a buddy system or guided support.",
