    "summary": "A scenic 12.9 km circular hike starting in Lynmouth that traverses the Watersmeet gorge and climbs Countisbury Hill, exposing a mix of river, woodland, and coastal viewpoints. Moderate in difficulty with some ascent and uneven terrain, suitable for hikers with decent fitness and comfortable in varied weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines riverside paths, woodland tracks, and coastal meadow sections. Expect a climb to Countisbury Hill with exposed cliff-top segments. Trails can be rocky, muddy, and uneven, with some stairs and narrow, overgrown sections. Conditions can be slippery when wet, and coastal winds may affect exposure near the ridge.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather on the UK coast can change rapidly; check a reliable forecast before you go. Wear sturdy boots with good grip and bring a waterproof layer. Stay on marked paths, be cautious on wet rocks and near cliff edges, and watch for mud and loose stones. Daylight hours may be limited in late autumn/winter; carry a map or GPS and inform someone of your planned route. Mobile signal can be patchy in remote sections of Exmoor/Devon shores.",
