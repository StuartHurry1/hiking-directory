Expect muddy stretches after rain, uneven footing, and several stiles and gates. The route features some moderate ascents with occasional short, steep sections and open exposed ground for views.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for UK weather and daylight; check forecasts and start times. Tell someone your route and estimated finish. Wear sturdy footwear and weather-appropriate clothing; waterproofs recommended. Be mindful of livestock on common land and keep dogs under control.
