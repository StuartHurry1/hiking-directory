    "summary": "A challenging 132.8 km long-distance hike from Exeter to Honiton in Devon, UK. The route traverses rural Devon countryside along a mix of lanes, public footpaths and bridleways, with several steep sections and long days on the trail.",

Stay hydrated and carry enough food; have high-energy snacks. Inform someone of your route and expected finish; carry a whistle and basic first aid kit.
