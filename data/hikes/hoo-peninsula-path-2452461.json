    "summary": "The Hoo Peninsula Path is a long-distance, hard-rated hike in the United Kingdom, spanning 102.6 km along the Hoo Peninsula. The route weaves coastal marshes, grassy flatlands, tidal edges, and rural lanes, demanding good endurance, navigation, and weather preparedness. Given its length, most hikers split it over multiple days and plan around tides and daylight.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of coastal marshland, salt flats, muddy tracks, grassy fields, and occasional paved sections. Ground can be soft and waterlogged after rain; wind exposure and sun can affect conditions. Navigation is generally straightforward but tidal areas or restricted zones may require detours.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan around tide tables and access restrictions on the peninsula. The route is long and physically demanding; ensure adequate training, pacing, and rest. Carry sufficient water and food, waterproof clothing, and a reliable map or GPS. Wear sturdy waterproof boots; check weather forecasts; carry a first aid kit and a means to signal for help. Let someone know your itinerary and expected finish time. Be aware of livestock, wildlife reserves, and restricted areas; be prepared for sudden weather changes and limited daylight in autumn/winter.",
