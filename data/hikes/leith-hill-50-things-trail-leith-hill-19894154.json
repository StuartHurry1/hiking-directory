    "summary": "Leith Hill '50 Things' Trail is a 7.9 km moderate hike in the UK, looping through woodland and open moorland to the summit area near Leith Hill Tower. The route offers a steady climb with rewarding views from the hilltop and ties in with the '50 Things' theme along the way. Suitable for hikers with moderate fitness and accessible on weekends.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail combines forest tracks, grassy moorland, and exposed hilltop sections. Expect uneven footing with roots and loose rocks, especially near the summit and tower area. The path is generally well-marked, though rain can make sections muddy. A mix of shaded woodland and open viewpoints provides variety and occasional panoramic views.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather can change quickly—check forecasts before you go. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and long clothing to guard against undergrowth and damp conditions. Stay on marked paths; watch for uneven ground, roots, and loose stones. Leith Hill Tower area can get busy; keep children and dogs under control and yield to others. Bring water, snacks, a map or offline navigation, and a basic first-aid kit. In winter, daylight is shorter; consider a headtorch and extra layers. Mobile signal may be weak in parts of the area; do not rely solely on your phone for navigation.",
