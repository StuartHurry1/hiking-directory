    "summary": "ACW Circular Walk 09 is a challenging 44.4 km circular route in the UK. Designed for experienced hikers, the walk combines long distance with varied terrain and elevation, demanding good navigation and endurance.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses a mix of grassy trails, muddy byways, rocky sections, and occasional road or paved paths. Footing can be uneven with stiles and gates; expect changes in surface, exposure to wind in open stretches, and potential mud after wet weather. The distance requires sustained effort and good pacing.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day on the trail: check the weather, start early to ensure daylight, and carry a reliable map and compass (or a GPS device). Inform someone of your planned route and expected return. Carry ample water (2–3 liters) and high-energy food, plus a weather-appropriate extra layer, waterproofs, and sturdy boots. Pack a basic first aid kit, a charged phone with power bank, a whistle, and emergency shelter if conditions deteriorate. Be prepared for navigation challenges in poorly marked sections and know your limits; turn back if weather or fatigue becomes unsafe.",
