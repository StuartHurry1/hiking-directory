    "summary": "Foss Walk is a challenging long-distance hike in the UK, spanning approximately 300.9 km. The route demands solid navigation, endurance, and time-management from experienced hikers, with varied terrain and multiple long days on trail.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail traverses a mix of country lanes, farm paths, woodland tracks, and occasional road sections. Expect muddy fields, grassy and rocky sections, boggy stretches, and modest elevation changes. Stiles and gates are common, and weather can alter footing, so good boots and waterproof layers are essential.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard, multi-day trek. Plan thoroughly: map and route knowledge, weather checks, and a feasible itinerary with overnight stops. Tell someone your plan and expected times. Carry sufficient food and water, a means to purify water, and a reliable navigation device. Wear sturdy footwear, adjust clothing for changing conditions, and be prepared for fatigue, reduced daylight, and sudden weather shifts. Be cautious on road sections and ensure you have a plan for emergencies.",
