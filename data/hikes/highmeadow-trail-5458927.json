    "summary": "Highmeadow Trail is a challenging 31.3 km hike in the UK, presenting a strenuous long-distance route with varied terrain, elevation gain, and remote sections. It is best tackled by experienced hikers who are prepared for changing weather and long day on the trail.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route features a mix of grassy uplands, rocky segments, and narrow paths. Expect steep climbs, uneven footing, boggy stretches, and occasional moorland crossings. Navigation is important in exposed sections; sections may be exposed to wind and rain with limited shelter alongside streaming or muddy ground after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a full day or consider a two-day hike. Check weather forecasts; conditions can change rapidly in the UK. Carry a fully charged phone and a map with compass or GPS, waterproof clothing, sturdy boots, and sufficient food and water. Tell someone your itinerary, have a waypoint or emergency plan, and be aware of fatigue and dehydration on long ascents. In boggy or wet areas, take care to avoid slips; watch for livestock and livestock gates. If visibility drops or storm risk increases, turn back.",
