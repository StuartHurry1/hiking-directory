    "summary": "A demanding long-distance coastal trek totaling 55.4 km. The Lulworth Range Walks combines rugged cliff-top paths, open moorland and sections within a military range. It offers sweeping sea views and varied terrain, but is a strenuous hard-rated route that benefits from careful planning, navigation and good weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Coastal cliff paths, chalk and limestone ridges, uneven tracks, exposed sections and occasional road/track crossings. Expect steep ascents and descents, potential mud, wind exposure and sections where access depends on range scheduling.",
    "safety_notes": "Check range status before you go: Lulworth Range Walks operate within an active military range and access can be restricted with little notice. Only go when the ranges are open, and follow posted closures and guidance. Plan for remote sections with limited mobile reception; carry a map, compass and a fully charged phone. Wear sturdy boots and weatherproof clothing; bring plenty of water and high-energy snacks. Be mindful of cliff edges, tides and coastal hazards, and hike with a companion when possible. In case of emergency, call 999.",
