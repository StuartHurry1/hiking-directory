    "terrain_summary": "Rugged coastal terrain with a mix of well-trodden paths, narrow cliff-edge sections, steps, and rocky, uneven ground. Expect exposed, windy sections and muddy patches after rain. Footing can be slippery near the cliff tops; stay well back from the edges and watch for erosion.",

Keep a safe distance from cliff edges, especially with children or dogs. Carry water and a small map or offline navigation on your phone; tell someone your route and expected return time. Be aware of shorter daylight during winter months and plan accordingly.",
