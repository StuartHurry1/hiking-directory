    "summary": "Knightley Way is a challenging long-distance trail in the UK, spanning 108.3 km. The route traverses varied countryside and demands solid stamina, good navigation, and thorough preparation. It is best tackled by experienced hikers looking for a multi-day trek.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed terrain across rural countryside in the UK: long stretches on footpaths and lanes, occasional boggy sections, stiles, gentle to steep ascents, and some road crossings. Elevation varies, and weather can significantly affect footing and conditions.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan and navigation: carry a current map and compass or GPS, know your route, and inform someone of your itinerary. Weather: UK weather is changeable; pack layered clothing, waterproof/windproof outerwear, and suitable footwear. Terrain/footing: wear sturdy boots, expect mud and uneven surfaces, and take care on descents. Daily pacing: plan rests, monitor fatigue, and be prepared to shorten or reroute if conditions worsen. Supplies: bring enough water and high-energy food; carry a means to purify water if refilling. Communications: mobile coverage may be limited in remote sections; carry a whistle and a fully charged power bank. Leave no trace: pack out waste and respect wildlife.",
