    "summary": "Crawley Greenway is a demanding 56.6 km long-distance hike in the UK. The route follows a linear corridor that combines surfaced paths along a former rail alignment with rural lanes and occasional urban sections. Designed for experienced hikers, this trek requires solid navigation, steady endurance, and careful planning for weather, daylight, and provisioning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain is varied but largely corridor-like: expect long stretches on surfaced paths with occasional gravel sections, interspersed with short rural lane segments. You may encounter muddy patches after rain, gates or stiles, and variable shade and sunlight. Overall elevation changes are moderate, but the distance keeps the route physically demanding.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a full-day or multi-day effort with attention to daylight hours. Carry maps or a GPS and know the route in advance. Bring adequate water and high-energy snacks, plus a warm, waterproof layer. Be mindful of road crossings and rural gate crossings; carry a whistle and have a way to contact someone if you’re cutting the hike short. If hiking solo, share your plan with someone and consider a check-in. In poor weather or if fatigue sets in, reassess whether to continue or shorten the route.",
