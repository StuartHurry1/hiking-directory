    "summary": "Liberty Trail is a strenuous 45.4 km long-distance hike in the UK, intended for experienced hikers. It features varied terrain, potential elevation gain, and weather variability that demands solid navigation skills and robust equipment.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of forest tracks, muddy footpaths, rocky sections, and open moorland. The route can include exposed ridges, stream crossings, and long, fatigue-prone stretches. Footing may be uneven and weather-dependent, so good footwear and navigation ability are essential.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a multi-day trek or long day with a strict schedule. Check the forecast and daylight hours; tell someone your route and expected return. Carry navigation tools (map and compass or GPS) and know how to use them. Start early to maximize daylight. Stay hydrated and fueled; carry extra food and water. Wear waterproof clothing, layer for warmth, and bring a hat and gloves. Have a first aid kit, whistle, and emergency shelter. In poor conditions, turn back or seek shelter; if in doubt, don’t push on beyond your comfort and skill level.",
