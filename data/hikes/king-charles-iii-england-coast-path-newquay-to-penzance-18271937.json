    "summary": "Hard coastal trek covering 54.3 km along the England Coast Path from Newquay to Penzance in Cornwall. A demanding route of cliff-top paths, beaches, and tidal sections with spectacular sea views and varied terrain.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect rugged cliff-top trails, uneven stony paths, occasional beach sections, and woodland stretches. The route includes exposed sections subject to wind and spray, short ascents and descents, and mud after rain. Tidal restrictions may apply to some beach crossings, so plan ahead.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long, demanding day or multiple days; check tide times and weather forecasts before each section.
