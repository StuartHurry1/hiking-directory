    "summary": "The Glevum Way is a challenging long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, covering about 110.6 km. The route traverses varied countryside, with significant elevation, mixed surfaces, and demanding mileage that requires careful planning and stamina.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rural lanes, field paths, woodland tracks, and occasional road crossings. Surfaces range from firm tracks to muddy, uneven ground with some rocky sections. Frequent ascents and descents demand good footwear and navigation stays straightforward due to waymarking, though weather can affect footing.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for long days and variable UK weather. Wear sturdy boots with good ankle support, carry waterproof clothing, and bring layers. Carry enough water and food, map and compass or a GPS device, and a means to navigate if signals fail. Start early to allow daylight for the distance, inform someone of your plan, and know emergency contacts. Be mindful of livestock, private land, and seasonal closures; adjust pace to conditions.",
