    "summary": "The Dane Valley Way is a challenging long-distance hike across varied UK countryside, spanning 152.7 km. Designed for experienced trekkers, it combines sustained distances with mixed terrain, elevation, and remote sections that require careful planning and good navigation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of muddy field paths, grassy lanes, rocky tracks, and ridgelines. The route traverses valleys and wooded hills, with exposed sections, potential boggy footprints after rain, and occasional river crossings. Navigation is generally straightforward on marked paths, but disorientation is possible in rough weather or dense cover.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard, multi-day trek. Plan for long days, variable UK weather, and potential navigation challenges. Carry updated maps and a compass (GPS as a backup), inform someone of your itinerary, and check weather and daylight hours before setting out. Stay hydrated, pace yourself, and be prepared for fatigue, slips on wet ground, and hypothermia in exposed areas.",
