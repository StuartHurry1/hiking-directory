    "summary": "Berwickshire Coastal Path is a challenging 106.1 km long-distance trail along Scotland’s southeast coast. With rugged cliffs, long beaches and estuaries, the route offers dramatic coastal scenery and remote sections. It is rated hard and typically completed over multiple days depending on pace.",

Carry a map and compass in addition to a GPS device, and keep a charged phone as a backup. Inform someone of your itinerary with estimated times. Wear sturdy footwear, dress in layers, and be mindful of cliff edges and unstable ground. Daylight hours are short in winter; dial 999 in an emergency.",
