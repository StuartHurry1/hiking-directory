    "summary": "The Loch Ryan Coastal Path is a demanding 25.7 km coastal hike along the southwest Scottish coast of the UK. The route loops around Loch Ryan, delivering expansive sea views, rugged shoreline, and a mix of terrain that requires good fitness and sturdy footwear. Plan as a long day hike or split into two shorter outings, with weather that can be highly variable even in summer.",
    "terrain_summary": "A mix of rocky shoreline, pebbled beaches, grassy cliff-top paths, and well-trodden coastal trails. Expect exposed sections with strong winds, uneven ground, and occasional mud after rain. Some segments feature steep ascents or descents; footwear with solid grip is essential. Certain beaches or flats may require careful timing around tides.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the forecast and tide/surf conditions before you go. Coastal winds can be sudden and strong; stay well inland from cliff edges and avoid narrow ledges in wet conditions. Start early to ensure daylight, and carry a map and compass even if you have a GPS. Bring enough water and high-energy food, a means to contact help, and a lightweight emergency layer. Mobile signal can be unreliable in remote sections—inform someone of your plan and expected return.",
