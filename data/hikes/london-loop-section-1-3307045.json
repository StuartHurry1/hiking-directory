    "summary": "London LOOP (Section 1) is a 21.5 km hard hike in the UK. The route traverses varied terrain and can include rural tracks, urban segments, and uneven ground, with potential elevation gain and muddy sections that demand good footing.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mixed surfaces: canal towpaths, footpaths, rural lanes, hedgerows, and some road sections. Ground can be muddy, uneven, and slippery after rain; you may encounter steps, stiles, gates, and exposed sections with limited shade.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long, possibly remote section. Wear sturdy boots, check weather, and carry navigation tools even if the path is marked. Bring enough water and snacks, a map/compass or GPS, a charged phone, and a small first aid kit. Be mindful of traffic at road crossings and private land boundaries; tell someone your plan and expected return. In winter, daylight is shorter and conditions can be tougher; consider starting early and dressing for wind and rain.",
