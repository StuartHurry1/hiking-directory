    "summary": "A strenuous 40 km circuit hike following the Leith Hill Greenway in the UK. The route combines forest and rural paths with sustained elevation, demanding experience and good navigation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed terrain with long ascents, forest tracks, grassy field paths, and occasional road crossings. Expect uneven ground, mud in wet weather, exposed ridges near the hill, and some rocky sections; navigation is important on rural segments.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard 40 km hike with significant elevation gain. Plan for a full day (8–12 hours) depending on pace. Check weather, as UK conditions can change rapidly; wear sturdy boots and bring appropriate layers and rain gear. Carry a map and compass or GPS, a charged phone as a backup, and inform someone of your route. Stay hydrated and fueled with regular snacks; watch for fatigue and hypothermia in exposed areas. Trails can be muddy and slippery, especially after rain; take care on declines and leaf-covered surfaces. In winter, daylight is limited; start early.",
