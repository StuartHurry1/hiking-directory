    "summary": "Lakeside Walk is a gentle 4.1 km circular route along a scenic lake in the UK. With easy terrain and level paths, it's ideal for beginners, families, and anyone seeking a relaxing lakeside stroll.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route follows well maintained paths that are mostly flat, with occasional gentle slopes. Expect some muddy patches near the water and short sections of wooden boardwalk. The surface is a mix of gravel, compacted earth, and grass, so footwear with good grip is advised.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the weather and daylight hours before you go. The lake edge can be slippery when wet. Stay on marked paths and watch for cyclists and other pedestrians. Keep children and pets under control near the water. Wear sturdy footwear and bring a waterproof layer in case of rain. Bring a map or charged phone for navigation and emergency contacts.",
