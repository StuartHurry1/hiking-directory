    "summary": "GM Ringway Stage 3 is a demanding 20.2 km hike in the UK. The route features sustained ascents and exposed sections across varied terrain, suited to experienced hikers with solid fitness and navigation skills.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of grassy moorland, rocky ridges, muddy tracks and uneven stone paths. Short steep climbs, boggy patches and occasional scrambling may occur. Weather can change quickly, especially at higher elevations, so be prepared and carry navigation aids as needed.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for rapidly changing UK conditions: check the forecast, daylight hours, and any access constraints. Tell someone your plan and expected return time. Carry sufficient water and high-energy food. Wear sturdy, ankle-supporting boots and dress in layers with a waterproof outer layer. Stay on marked paths where possible; watch for loose stones, wet rocks and boggy sections. Carry a map and compass, with a GPS device as backup, and know how to navigate. Bring a headlamp, spare batteries, a basic first aid kit, a whistle, and a means to signal for help. In winter, expect ice and snow; consider crampons, an ice axe, and extra time for a safe descent. If conditions worsen or you feel exhausted, turn back to a safer point.",
