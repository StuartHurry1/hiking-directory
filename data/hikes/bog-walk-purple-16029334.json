    "summary": "A moderate 8 km bog-side walk in the UK countryside, offering marshy terrain and open wetland scenery. Expect soft ground, occasional mud, and varying visibility depending on weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses marshy bogland with waterlogged, soft ground and uneven footing. Expect mud, peat, and damp vegetation; parts may have wet grass, and underfoot can be slippery. Ground conditions can change with rainfall, and in drier conditions may be firmer ground along established paths.",
    "safety_notes": "Check weather and for any bog-specific hazards before you go. Wear waterproof, high-ankle boots with good grip; bring spare socks. Stay on marked paths where possible; avoid deep bog openings. Use trekking poles if needed for stability. Carry a map, compass or GPS, sufficient water, and a snack. Tell someone your plan and expected return time. Be mindful of cold or rapidly changing weather; in bogs, visibility can be reduced by mist or rain.",
