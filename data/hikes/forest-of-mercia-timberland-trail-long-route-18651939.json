    "summary": "The Forest of Mercia Timberland Trail (Long Route) is a demanding 20.7 km hike through UK woodlands. As a hard-rated route, it combines forest tracks, rooty footpaths, and occasional boggy stretches with some elevation gain. Suitable for experienced hikers with good navigation skills, it rewards with quiet forest scenery, wildlife, and a sense of wilderness. Plan for a full day, check weather, and follow Leave No Trace principles.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain varies from smooth forest tracks to uneven, root-covered paths and damp ground. Expect muddy sections after rain, intermittent open glades with exposed footing, some short steep ascents and descents, and occasional boulder or rock crossings. Navigation relies on waymarkers and possibly cross-country routes, so bring a map or GPS.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, hard hike in potentially variable UK weather. Prepare for rapid changes; carry waterproofs and extra layers. Stay on marked paths, watch footing on roots and rocks, and avoid risky sections after rain. Bring a map and compass; know how to use them, as mobile signal can be unreliable. Inform someone of your planned return time. Carry a whistle, know your emergency procedures, and pack a charged phone with offline maps. If conditions become unsafe, turn back early.",

    ],
    "best_seasons": "Late spring to early autumn (roughly May to September) generally offers the driest and longest daylight days. Shoulder seasons can be good with proper gear, but winter hiking requires experience and extra caution due to mud and reduced daylight.",
