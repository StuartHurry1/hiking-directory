    "summary": "Hanna's Close - Green Lane Walk is a 7.3 km moderate hike in the UK that follows a traditional green lane. The route offers grassy, tree-lined scenery with sections that may be muddy after rain and occasional gates or stiles to negotiate. Suitable for walkers with moderate fitness and a sense of adventure, the walk is accessible year-round with appropriate footwear and preparation.",
    "terrain_summary": "The terrain is typical of a UK green lane: predominantly grassy or compact earth underfoot, with uneven spots and potential mud in wet weather. Expect gates, stiles, and occasional hedgerows; some stretches may be narrow or bordered by low walls or hedges, and visibility can vary in overgrown sections.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan according to daylight and weather. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and dress in layers, as conditions can change quickly on exposed lanes. Stay on the public right of way, be prepared for gates and stiles, and watch for livestock. Check the forecast, carry a map or GPS, and have a charged phone; let someone know your route and expected return time. In wet conditions, walk carefully to avoid slipping, and be mindful of farm traffic or vehicles on wider lanes. Keep dogs on a lead where required.",
