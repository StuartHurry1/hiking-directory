    "summary": "A challenging long-distance coastal hike along the England Coast Path from Whitehaven to Silecroft. Covering about 97.4 km, this hard route traverses rugged coastline, windy headlands, beaches, and occasional inland connectors, with varying terrain and exposure.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily cliff-top and coastal paths, with sections of rocky terrain, sandy beaches, mud flats, and exposed ridges. Expect uneven footing, spray from the sea, and strong winds off the Irish Sea. Some stretches are remote with limited services, and navigation may rely on signs, maps, and GPS.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a remote coastal route with significant exposure. Weather can change rapidly; be prepared for wind, rain, and cold even in summer. Some sections involve exposed cliff edges and long non-serviced stretches. Carry navigation tools (map, compass, and GPS), fully charged devices, and inform someone of your plans. Check tide times before beach crossings and avoid crossings at high tide or rough seas. Plan multi-day stages with bail-out options and know your limits; turn back if conditions deteriorate.",
