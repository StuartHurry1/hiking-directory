    "summary": "The 8 mile loop is a hard 24.3 km hike in the United Kingdom. With no specific region provided, it offers a demanding long-distance route suitable for experienced hikers seeking a substantial daytime trek.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect varied UK terrain including long sections of uneven trail, rocky steps, grassy gradients, and likely boggy ground after rain. Significant elevation changes or exposed sections on moorland or ridges are common, with mud and wet conditions possible year-round.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan around changing UK weather; always carry a map and compass and know how to navigate, as mobile reception can be poor. Stay on marked paths, start early to ensure daylight, and inform someone of your route and timings. Be prepared for mud, slippery rocks, and potential river or stream crossings. Pack clothing for all conditions, including a waterproof shell, and carry enough water and high-energy food. Watch for fatigue, know your limits, and carry a whistle and a basic first aid kit. In an emergency, dial 999 or 112.",
