    "summary": "The Herefordshire Trail is a challenging long-distance hike in the United Kingdom, offering a substantial circuit around Herefordshire, England. Covering roughly 719 km, it threads rolling farmland, river valleys, woodlands, and historic villages, rewarding experienced trekkers with diverse landscapes and a true sense of the countryside.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of rural lanes, hedged fields, woodland edges, open farmland, and occasional river crossings. The route includes stiles, minor tracks, and potentially boggy sections after rain. Navigation is generally straightforward, but carrying a map and compass (or GPS) is advised for confidence across the entire circuit.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for UK weather variability (rain, fog, wind, heat). Carry a reliable map and compass or GPS, and don't rely on mobile signal. Be prepared for cattle on farmland and keep gates closed. Expect uneven paths, steps, and potential mud; wear sturdy footwear and dress in layers. Share your itinerary with someone, carry sufficient food and water, and have an emergency plan for storms or injury.",
