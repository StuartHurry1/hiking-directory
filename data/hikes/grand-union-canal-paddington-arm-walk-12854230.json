    "summary": "A long-distance hike along the Grand Union Canal Paddington Arm in the UK, spanning about 34.1 km. The route runs mainly along canal towpaths with a mix of urban and rural scenery, historic locks, and period features. The hike is demanding due to distance and the need for good planning, but the flat terrain makes it feasible for well-prepared walkers comfortable with long days.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly flat canal towpath. Surfaces are mostly compact gravel or tarmac with some uneven sections and occasional muddy patches after rain. Expect a mix of urban street sections and quieter rural stretches; elevation changes occur mainly at locks and where the towpath detours away from the water.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan around daylight hours, check for towpath closures or maintenance, and be mindful of weather and water safety along the canal edge. Wear sturdy boots, carry water and snacks, a map or offline navigation app, a fully charged phone, and a small first-aid kit. Tell someone your route and expected finish time. Be aware of cyclists and other canal users; keep to the left and announce your presence. In urban sections, stay alert to traffic and crowded pavements; in wet conditions, the path can be slippery.",
