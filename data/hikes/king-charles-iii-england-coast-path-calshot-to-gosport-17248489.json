    "summary": "A challenging 61.7 km section of the England Coast Path following the Hampshire coast from Calshot to Gosport. This hard coastal hike features sea views across the Solent, exposed headlands, shingle beaches, and cliff-top trails with variable footing and weather. Plan for multiple days, consider tides, and prepare for strong coastal winds.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily coastal path along mixed surfaces including chalk headlands, shingle beaches, and occasional boardwalks. Expect uneven footing, exposed sections, possible cliff edges, and tidal influences near the water. Long stretches with limited resupply opportunities; navigation and staying on official paths are important.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times and weather forecasts before setting out; some sections may be inaccessible at high tide. Carry a map, compass or GPS, and a fully charged phone with offline maps. Be prepared for strong winds, sun exposure, and cold water. Wear sturdy footwear and layered clothing; inform someone of your itinerary; have a plan for breaks and accommodation if needed. In an emergency, dial 999. Coastal erosion and changing conditions can affect footing; stay away from unstable edges.",
