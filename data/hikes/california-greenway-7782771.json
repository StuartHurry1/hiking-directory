    "summary": "The California Greenway is a 9.6 km moderately challenging hike in the United Kingdom. The route blends grassy tracks with gravel paths and some rooty sections, offering steady but not technical terrain and views of surrounding countryside. Suitable for walkers with some experience who have solid footwear and conditioning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of well-defined trails, grassy paths, and gravel tracks. The elevation change is gradual with some short, steeper sections; the surface can be uneven underfoot, and rooty patches may appear in shaded sectors. Overall, it’s a moderate, day-length hike that can be completed in a few hours depending on pace.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for typical UK conditions: check the weather forecast, as rain can make trails slick and visibility poor. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and bring a light rain jacket. Carry a map or offline navigation, a charged phone, water, and snacks. Start early in shorter days, watch for daylight savings, and be mindful of other hikers on narrow sections. Let someone know your route and expected return time.",
