    "summary": "An ambitious coastal trek on the Isle of Wight, the Compton Bay and Downs Walk covers 37.4 km of sea cliffs, chalk downs and rural lanes. It threads dramatic coastal scenery from Compton Bay along exposed downs, with sweeping sea views, rugged ground and remote stretches.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines rugged coastal paths along chalk cliffs, exposed downland ridges, uneven footing and stone tracks, plus quiet farm lanes and occasional road sections. Expect steep ascents and descents, loose gravel, and variable weather and wind exposure.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, exposed coastal route. Check weather conditions, tides, and wind; stay well back from cliff edges, as erosion can be unpredictable.
