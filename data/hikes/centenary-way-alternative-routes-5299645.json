    "summary": "Centenary Way - Alternative routes is a challenging long distance hike in the United Kingdom, featuring approximately 187.9 km of alternative segments linked to the main Centenary Way. The route traverses a mix of rural countryside, woodlands, rolling hills and potential coastal or estuary sections, with substantial elevation changes and multiple days on the trail.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a varied terrain profile with hedged country lanes, muddy footpaths, farmland tracks, woodlands, open moorland, and occasional rocky or stony sections. Some parts may be remote with limited services, so navigation and map reading are important. Prepare for long ascents and steep descents, and variable weather that can shift quickly in the UK.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a hard long distance hike. Plan for multi day trips with proper navigation skills and route planning. Carry a detailed map and compass, and consider a GPS backup. Check weather forecasts and daylight hours; be prepared for rain, cold, and wind, especially on exposed sections. Tell someone your planned route and expected timings. Pack sufficient water, food, and emergency gear; watch for fatigue, and adjust pace to avoid injury. Be aware of road crossings, livestock, and potential closures.",

    "best_seasons": "Late spring to early autumn in the UK (roughly May to September) offers the best balance of daylight and weather for this route. Spring and autumn can also be good but expect more variable conditions. Winter hiking is not recommended due to short days, stronger storms, and higher risk in remote sections.",
