    "summary": "A scenic 11.3 km moderate hike to the summit of Cairnsmore of Carsphairn via the Green Well. The route crosses upland moorland with grassy tracks, occasional rocky sections, and rewarding views over the surrounding countryside.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of grassy upland paths, open moorland, and occasional rocky sections near the summit. The ground can be uneven and boggy after rain, and wind exposure increases at higher elevations. The route is non-technical but navigation and sturdy footwear are important.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in UK uplands can change rapidly. Check the forecast before you go and plan for shorter daylight hours in shoulder seasons. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layered, windproof clothing. Carry a map and compass or GPS; do not rely on mobile signal. Bring enough water and high-energy snacks, a basic first aid kit, a whistle, and a lightweight emergency layer. Stay on marked paths, be mindful of livestock and fences, and inform someone of your plans.",
