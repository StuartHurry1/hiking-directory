    "summary": "A challenging 26.3 km circuit at Knepp Wildland in the UK. The Red Route combines open downs, hedgerow paths, and woodland tracks for a demanding day hike with variable terrain and wildlife viewing opportunities.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses open grassland, gravel bridleways, muddy in-field paths, woodland edges, and occasional road sections. Expect uneven footing, potential mud after rain, cattle grids, and exposed, windy sections on the downs.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day: 26.3 km with significant elevation. Check the forecast and daylight hours. Carry a map and compass (or GPS), and know your limits. Stay on marked paths, and be mindful of livestock; give cattle space and avoid disturbing birds and other wildlife. Bring enough water (2–3 L) and high-energy snacks. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and layers; weather can change quickly. Mobile signal may be limited; tell someone your route and ETA. Carry a whistle and basic first aid, plus a light source if you may be out near dusk.",
