    "summary": "Historic Fortifications Trail is a challenging 33.5 km hike in the UK that follows historical fortifications across varied countryside. The route combines long-distance trekking with uneven terrain and elevation changes, demanding good navigation and endurance.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail starts on firm paths and transitions to grassy ascents, loose gravel, and rocky sections. Expect muddy stretches after rain, exposed ridges in places, and several long climbs with steep descents. Navigation can be tricky on segments where signage fades, so carrying a map and compass is advisable.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for 8–12 hours of trekking depending on pace. Wear sturdy boots and bring weather-appropriate layers. The route includes uneven ground, mud, and occasional scrambling; some sections are remote with limited phone signal. Always carry a map and compass, inform someone of your itinerary, check local conditions, and be prepared for sudden weather changes. Daylight is shorter in winter, and staying hydrated is essential.",
