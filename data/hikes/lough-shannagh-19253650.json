    "summary": "The Lough Shannagh hike is a challenging 19.1 km loop in the UK that circles Lough Shannagh. The route blends lake-edge paths with rolling hills, delivering steady ascents, rocky sections, and a demanding day for experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "Varied terrain includes grassy moorland, gravel tracks, rocky outcrops, and woodland around the lake. Expect wet and muddy sections, uneven footing, and some steep ascents and descents.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the weather before you go; UK conditions can change quickly on exposed hills. The route traverses remote sections with limited mobile coverage, so carry a map and compass (or a reliable GPS) and inform someone of your plan. Wear sturdy boots and dress in layers with a waterproof outer layer. Be prepared for slippery rocks near the water, variable visibility, and fatigue—carry enough water and energy snacks, and consider a spare power bank for devices.",
