    "summary": "A challenging 100.2 km section of the King Charles III England Coast Path from Gretna to Allonby, offering rugged coastal scenery, long distances, and exposed headlands. The route traverses beach, cliff-top trails, and tidal flats along the Cumbria and Solway coast, demanding solid navigation and fitness from experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly coastal trail with a mix of cliff-top paths, pebbled beaches, tidal flats, boardwalks, and farm tracks. Expect uneven surfaces, exposed winds, and occasional mud; some stretches may have eroded edges or require careful footing near the shore. Navigation relies on marked paths and map reading over long sections with limited services.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan around tides and weather: check local tide tables and avoid crossing low beaches at high tide. Wear sturdy boots and stay on the official path where marked. Carry a detailed map or GPS, plus a compass and a charged phone for emergencies. Expect remote sections with limited mobile coverage; carry sufficient water, food, and a basic first aid kit. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected finish time. Take extra care on cliff edges and slippery surfaces during wet or windy conditions.",
