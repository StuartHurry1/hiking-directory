    "safety_notes": "Always check the weather before you go and be prepared for sudden changes in the UK. Wear sturdy boots and dress in layers. Carry a map and compass (or fully charged GPS) and do not rely solely on smartphones. Tell someone your planned route and expected return time. Bring enough water and a snack, plus a small first aid kit. If the trail is exposed or winds are high, consider sun protection and warm layers. In winter, be mindful of ice and shorter daylight; plan for shorter daylight hours and have a headtorch. If the path runs near roads or water, stay on marked paths and watch for mud and slippery rock.",
