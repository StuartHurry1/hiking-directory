    "summary": "GM Ringway Stage 1 is a 20.2 km hard hike in the UK, serving as the opening stage of the GM Ringway route.

    "safety_notes": "Plan around variable UK weather and daylight; check forecasts and shorten or postpone if conditions are unsafe. Wear sturdy boots with good grip and carry waterproofs and extra layers. Bring a map, compass or GPS, and ensure your phone is charged. Stay on marked paths, watch for traffic on road sections, and let someone know your route and expected finish time. Carry sufficient water and snacks, a basic first aid kit, and an emergency whistle. In remote sections, have a means to call for help and consider a lightweight, portable shelter if rain is forecast.",
