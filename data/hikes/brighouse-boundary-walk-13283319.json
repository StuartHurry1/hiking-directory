    "summary": "The Brighouse Boundary Walk is a hard, 76-kilometre long-distance circuit in the United Kingdom. It weaves through a mix of urban streets, farmland, and open countryside, demanding good navigation, robust fitness, and careful planning from experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route combines surfaced paths, gravel tracks, field margins, and occasional rough or grassy sections. Expect rolling to steep ascents, hedgerows, potential boggy ground after rain, and some exposed moorland or high points. Navigation accuracy is important in rural gaps and long stretches between settlements.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a strenuous route with long distances between towns. Prepare a robust navigation plan (carry a map and compass or GPS), check weather forecasts, and start early to ensure daylight. Tell someone your GPX or planned timing. Wear sturdy hiking boots, bring sufficient water and food, and carry a waterproof layer. Be prepared for remote sections, and have a means of emergency contact.",
