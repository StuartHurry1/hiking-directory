    "summary": "The Eynort Loop is a 16.7 km hard hike in the UK, combining rugged coastal moorland, rocky ascents, and long stretches of uneven terrain. It rewards with open sea views but demands good fitness, navigation, and preparation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Rugged and varied: rocky paths, grassy uplands, boggy patches, and exposed ridgelines. Expect steep ascents and descents, uneven footing, and wind exposure on exposed sections. Trails can be muddy after rain; waterproof boots and solid traction are essential.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the forecast and daylight hours before setting out. The route includes exposed sections and coastal elements, so navigation can be challenging in poor visibility; carry a map and compass or GPS, and know your escape routes. Be aware of tides and cliff edges if the path runs along the coast. Start early to ensure a safe return in daylight. Share your plan with someone, bring enough water and food, and carry a basic first aid kit and a means to signal for help.",
