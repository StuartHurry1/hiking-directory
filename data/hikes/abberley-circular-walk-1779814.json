    "summary": "A challenging 16.5 km circular hike from Abberley that covers varied countryside including grassy lanes, hedged fields and woodland paths. The route includes several ascents and descents, uneven surfaces and potential mud, making it best suited to experienced hikers with good navigation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of surfaces: well-defined tracks, grassy field edges, woodland paths, and occasional road sections. Surfaces can be muddy after rain; gates and stiles require steps and balance. The route features both gentle and more sustained climbs, with occasional open country exposures and distant views. Navigation is straightforward on well-marked paths but some sections may be faint in poor visibility.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for changing UK weather and daylight hours. Wear sturdy, waterproof hiking boots and warm layers. Bring a map or GPS, compass, and a fully charged phone. Carry enough water and snacks, plus a small first-aid kit and emergency whistle. Respect livestock and farmland gates, and take care on road crossings. Inform someone of your route and expected return time.",
