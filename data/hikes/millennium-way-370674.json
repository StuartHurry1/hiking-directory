    "summary": "Millennium Way is a challenging 67.4 km hiking route in the UK. This multi day trek traverses varied countryside and rural landscapes, demanding high fitness, careful planning, and good navigation. Expect elevation changes, long days on foot, and sections of rough terrain; pace yourself and arrange accommodation as needed.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of terrains: well-made footpaths, farm tracks, and country lanes, with occasional muddy fields and stiles. Surfaces can be uneven, and you may encounter hedgerows, exposed ridges, and boggy stretches. Some parts pass through villages or towns, so route planning for road crossings is helpful. Weather in the UK can be changeable, so be prepared for sun, rain, and wind.",
    "safety_notes": "Carry a detailed plan and share it with someone. Check local notices for closures and weather. Carry maps, a compass or GPS, and a fully charged phone as backup. Stay on established paths, watch for cattle or livestock on rural sections, and be aware of traffic when routes pass along roads. Pack sufficient water and food, take regular breaks, and know your limits. In poor weather or after dark you may need extra lighting and emergency shelter.",
