    "summary": "Ivanhoe Way is a hard, long-distance route in the UK that covers about 116.9 km. The path traverses a mix of countryside, hedgerows and minor road sections, demanding good fitness, navigation skills and careful planning across multiple days.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect varied terrain typical of UK long-distance trails: woodland and field paths, rural lanes and occasional road sections, with variable surfaces and elevation gains. Weather and footing can change quickly, so be prepared for a range of conditions.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan thoroughly before you start: check the forecast and daylight hours, map your route, and share your itinerary with someone. Carry a detailed map and compass in addition to a GPS device, and know how to navigate if devices fail. Bring enough water and food for each day, estimate realistic daily distances, and pace yourself to avoid exhaustion. Start early to maximize daylight, stay on official paths, and know where to seek help if needed. Have a plan for shelter or emergency stops in bad weather.",
