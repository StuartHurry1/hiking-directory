    "summary": "A demanding 17.8 km hike along the Grand Union Canal (Slough Arm) in the UK. The route follows a long, flat towpath through a mix of rural and urban scenery, with canal-side views, locks, and bridges. Though the profile is generally level, the distance and potential mud make it a hard day out; pace yourself, take breaks, and monitor weather and daylight.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily canal towpath with a flat profile. Surfaces range from compacted gravel and asphalt in built-up sections to grassy or muddy patches in rural stretches. Watch for wet conditions near the water, locks, and bridges; some segments can be busy with other walkers and cyclists.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for daylight hours and weather; stay clear of the water’s edge, especially near locks; share the path with cyclists and keep to the left where indicated; carry water and snacks; wear sturdy footwear; bring a map or offline route; let someone know your plans; avoid starting late in poor light or icy conditions.",
