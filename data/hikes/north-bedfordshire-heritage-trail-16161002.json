    "summary": "The North Bedfordshire Heritage Trail is a demanding 228.6 km long-distance trek through the northern countryside of Bedfordshire, UK. Intended for experienced hikers, the route combines rural farmland, hedgerow lanes, woodlands and historic villages, offering a mix of scenic landscapes and cultural landmarks. Expect multiple long day sections, varied footing, occasional road crossings, and elevation changes typical of northern England countryside. Proper planning, pacing, and accommodation arrangements are essential for a safe and enjoyable thru- or long-distance hike.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain varies from grassy field paths and hedgerow lanes to woodland trails and canal towpaths, with sections on minor roads. Expect muddy sections after rain, uneven footing, stiles and gates, and occasional short, steeper climbs. Footing can be slippery in damp conditions and weather can change quickly in the UK, so a sturdy pair of boots and adaptable clothing are advised.",
    "safety_notes": "Always plan for multi-day trekking by informing someone of your itinerary and expected return. Check the forecast and potential weather-related hazards before starting, and be prepared for sudden changes. Carry a map and compass (or GPS) and know how to use them, and keep to public rights of way. Stay hydrated and fueled with regular food and water; have a backup power source for navigation devices. Be mindful of road crossings and other traffic, especially on longer rural sections. In remote stretches, phone signal may be limited—carry emergency contact details and a whistle, and know basic first-aid and safety procedures. Practice Leave No Trace and respect livestock and private property.",
