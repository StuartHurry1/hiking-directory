    "summary": "GM Ringway Stage 13 is a hard, 40.6 km segment of the GM Ringway in the United Kingdom. The route combines urban sections with rural scenery, demanding solid stamina, good navigation, and weather preparedness. Suitable for experienced long-distance hikers who can manage a full-day or multi-day pace depending on breaks.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mixed landscape: quiet rural lanes, farm tracks, woodland paths, occasional steep sections, and urban street segments. Footing ranges from smooth tarmac to muddy trails; you’ll encounter gates, stiles, and uneven ground. Weather in the UK can change quickly, so be prepared for variable conditions and mud.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan the route in advance and check current conditions. Carry a map and compass or GPS, plus a fully charged phone with offline maps.

Wear sturdy boots and layered, weather-appropriate clothing, including a waterproof layer. Be prepared for mud, uneven terrain, and road crossings. Bring a small first-aid kit, emergency whistle, and a means to signal for help. Consider daylight hours and have backup transport plans if needed. Practice Leave No Trace and respect property and livestock.",
