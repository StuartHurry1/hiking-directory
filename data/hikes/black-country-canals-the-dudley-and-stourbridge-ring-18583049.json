    "summary": "A demanding 56.1 km circular hike around the Black Country canal network, connecting the Dudley and Stourbridge areas. The route blends canal towpaths, urban sections, and occasional ridgeline viewpoints. Classified as hard due to the distance and mixed surfaces, it suits experienced hikers prepared for a long day or a multi-day outing with careful pacing and planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mostly canal towpaths and urban/travel surfaces with some unpaved tracks. Expect smooth pavement on many sections, with occasional muddy or grassy stretches after rain. Elevation gain is spread across several shorter climbs around the ridge-like sections near the watercourses, but the overall climbs are modest; the main challenge is the long total distance and variable footing.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a long day (or two) with daylight and weather considerations. Tell someone your route and timings. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and dress in layers. Carry a map and compass or offline GPS, plus a fully charged phone. Stay hydrated and fueled with regular snacks; know where to refill water along the canal towns. Be mindful of canal traffic, road crossings, and transitions between towpaths and urban streets. Check weather forecasts for rain and wind; carry a waterproof layer and potentially extra warmth. In rural sections, keep to marked paths and watch for uneven surfaces, mud, and overgrown edges. If conditions deteriorate, have a planned bailout point in a nearby town.",
