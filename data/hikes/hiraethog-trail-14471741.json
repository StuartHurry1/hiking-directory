    "summary": "The Hiraethog Trail is a demanding long-distance hike in the UK, covering about 149.5 km. It traverses varied terrain and requires solid fitness, navigation, and careful planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of surfaces: forest tracks, open moorland, and possibly rocky sections, plus occasional road or gravel paths. Terrain can be uneven, boggy after rain, and exposed on higher ground. Navigation is important in areas with limited waymarking.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, hard-distance hike. Plan for multiple days and check weather and daylight hours. Carry navigation tools (map, compass, and GPS as backup). Tell someone your itinerary. Bring sufficient food and water with backups, and have warm clothing, waterproofs, and emergency shelter. Be prepared for boggy sections, variable conditions, limited services, and the potential for fatigue or hypothermia. Hike with a partner if possible.",
