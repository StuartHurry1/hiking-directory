    "summary": "Fethaland East is a hard 32.4 km hike in the UK, combining rugged coastal paths with exposed moorland. It is suited to experienced walkers and can demand solid navigation, weather preparedness, and long daylight hours. Expect substantial elevation changes, long sections with little shelter, and variable conditions.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses coastal cliff and ridge paths, rough grass moorland, and rocky sections. Ground is uneven with boggy patches, especially after rain. Winds are often strong along the coast, and some sections are exposed and scrambling-like, though not technical climbing. Total elevation gain is variable depending on route choice.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times and weather before setting out; stay well back from cliff edges and avoid exposed ridges in strong winds. Carry a map and compass as navigation aids (GPS can fail in remote areas). Do not rely on mobile signal. Start with ample daylight; carry a plan for weather changes, extra food and water, and a means of communication or emergency beacon. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected return.",
