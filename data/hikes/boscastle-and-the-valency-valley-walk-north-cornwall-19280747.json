    "summary": "A 13.4 km moderate coastal walk starting and finishing in Boscastle, Cornwall. The route combines cliff-top coastal paths with a pleasant detour into the Valency Valley, offering sea views, estuary scenery, woodland trails and farmland tracks. Suitable for walkers with some experience, featuring undulating terrain, occasional steps and gates, and exposed sections along the coast.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly coastal paths along the North Cornwall cliffs, interspersed with woodland and field tracks. Expect uneven, rocky or grassy surfaces, gates and stiles, short steep sections, and occasional muddy patches after rain. Some coastal sections are exposed with uneven footing and narrow paths beside the cliff edge; there are several viewpoints overlooking the sea and the Valency Valley.",
    "safety_notes": "Check tide times and weather before setting out, as coastal sections can be exposed and slippery. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and bring layered clothing for wind and rain; Cornwall weather can change quickly. Stay away from cliff edges, keep children and dogs under control, and don't linger near unstable sections. Carry a map or GPS, sufficient water and snacks, a charged phone (signal may be patchy in the valley), a small first-aid kit and a whistle for emergencies. Allow plenty of time to complete the loop in daylight.",
