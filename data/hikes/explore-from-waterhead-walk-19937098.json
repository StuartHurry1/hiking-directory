    "summary": "Explore from Waterhead Walk is a roughly 6.5 km route in the UK that follows riverside and woodland paths, delivering scenic countryside views with a moderate elevation profile. The hike suits walkers with some experience and flexible footing, and can be done as a straightforward out-and-back or a short loop depending on the chosen start point. Expect a mix of gravel tracks, grass verges, and occasional uneven sections, with mud possible after rain.",
    "terrain_summary": "The trail mainly uses gravel and dirt paths, with some grassy stretches and occasional boardwalks.

    "safety_notes": "Check the weather forecast before you go; UK conditions can change quickly. Wear sturdy footwear and bring layers, a waterproof shell, and enough water.
