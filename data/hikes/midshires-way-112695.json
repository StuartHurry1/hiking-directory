    "summary": "The Midshires Way is a monumental, hard-rated long-distance trail in the UK centered on ridge walking across varied landscapes. Spanning roughly 2801.1 km, the route demands endurance, solid navigation, and careful multi-day planning.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily ridge terrain with long crest lines, exposed summits, and rugged paths. Expect rocky tracks, heather moorland, peat bogs, and occasional streams. Weather can be highly changeable and winds on exposed sections can be strong; accurate navigation is essential over the course of many days.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, hard route with extensive ridge walking. Carry navigation tools (OS map, compass, and GPS as backup) and know how to use them. Check forecasts; ridges can be exposed to sudden storms and strong winds. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and layered clothing; bring a waterproof shell, hat, and gloves. Plan for multi-day logistics with planned campsites or accommodations and carry sufficient food and water, using purification as needed. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected return; carry a whistle and a means of signaling for help. Respect access rights and camping rules where applicable; be mindful of wildlife and environmental impact.",
