    "summary": "The Glen Tilt Trail is a strenuous 28.2 km route through rugged Scottish countryside. As a hard level hike, it requires good fitness, solid navigation, and preparation for variable weather. The route combines forest tracks, rocky riverbanks, and open moorland with several stream crossings and steep sections.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of muddy forest tracks, rocky slabs, peat bogs, and river crossings. Surfaces are uneven and can be slippery after rain. Some stretches are exposed with short climbs; navigation aids are helpful in mist as paths can be indistinct.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather in the Highlands can change quickly. Always carry waterproofs and extra layers. The trail is remote with limited cell coverage in parts; bring a map and compass and know how to use them. Long, rough sections and river crossings demand good footwear and judgment, especially after rain. Tell someone your route and expected return time. Pack a first aid kit, sufficient food and water, a headlamp, and a whistle. Consider trekking poles for stability. If conditions are flooded, icy, or severe, postpone the hike.",
