    "summary": "A demanding long-distance hike along the Grand Union Canal in the UK, covering about 243.6 km. The route follows flat towpaths for the most part, interspersed with locks, cuttings, and occasional road crossings. It rewards endurance with steady daily miles but requires careful planning for meals, accommodation, and weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Primarily flat canal towpaths with compacted gravel and paved sections. Surface can be uneven and muddy after rain, and some stretches are grassy or rural tracks. Expect frequent lock gates and occasional street or rural crossings. Weather and water levels can affect footing and pace.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for long days and variable UK weather. Carry sufficient warm and waterproof clothing, map or GPS, water and food, and a first aid kit. Stay aware of towpath traffic (pedestrians and cyclists) and avoid close proximity to canal edges. Share your itinerary with someone, check for maintenance closures, and be prepared for limited services between towns. Allow extra time for locks and potential delays.",
