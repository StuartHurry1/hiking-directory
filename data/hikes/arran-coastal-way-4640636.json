    "summary": "The Arran Coastal Way is a demanding 161.4 km coastal circuit around the Isle of Arran in Scotland. It traverses rugged sea cliffs, sandy beaches, moorland, and forests, with frequent elevation changes and exposed sections. As a hard long-distance route, it requires solid navigation, thorough preparation, and good weather judgment.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect mainly coastal paths and cliff-top tracks with rocky surfaces, mixed with forest trails and occasional roads. Terrain ranges from rough, uneven ground and wet, slippery sections to gentle coastal paths; long ascents near headlands and long, exposed coastlines demand stamina and careful footing. Be prepared for wind and sea spray.",
    "safety_notes": "Weather on Scotland’s coast can change rapidly; carry appropriate clothing and protection. Some stretches are remote with limited phone signal—bring a map, compass, and GPS, and inform someone of your plan and daily targets. Pack adequate food, water, and a means to purify water if needed. Check tide times for any beach crossings and avoid exposed cliffs in bad conditions. Start early in winter and carry a reliable light source; let someone know if plans change.",
