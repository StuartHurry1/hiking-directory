    "summary": "Maywick Deepdale coastal route is a short, easy 2.4 km coastal walk in the UK, offering sea views, rocky shoreline, and a gentle, well-defined path that suits beginners and casual hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route follows a coastal track that is mostly flat to gently undulating with compact gravel and packed soil.

Stay on the marked path, keep a safe distance from cliff edges, and be prepared for sudden weather changes; wear sturdy, grippy footwear and bring a windproof/waterproof layer, a map or GPS, and a small first aid kit. Carry a charged phone, know local emergency numbers, and tell someone your planned return time.",
