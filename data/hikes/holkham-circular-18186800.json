    "summary": "Holkham Circular is a demanding 19.1 km coastal hike in the UK that combines sandy beaches, dune trails, and marsh-edge paths. The route offers expansive sea views and wildlife but requires good stamina and favorable weather, with exposure to wind and changing tides. Plan for several hours and check tide times before starting.",
    "terrain_summary": "A varied coastal terrain: long stretches on solid beach sections (with soft sand at times), shingle and chalk paths, wooden boardwalks through dunes, and wooded or marsh-edge trails. Expect uneven surfaces, dunes to climb, and potential mud after rain; some sections are exposed to wind with limited shelter.",
    "safety_notes": "Check local tide tables and seasonal access notes for the beach sections. Do not attempt to traverse the route if the tide will cut off your return.

Be mindful of weather changes and wildlife; keep dogs under control where required.",
