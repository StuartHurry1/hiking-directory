    "summary": "The Loch A Choire Route is a demanding 21.6 km hike in the UK, suited to experienced walkers. It combines long distance with rugged, variable terrain and potential exposure, requiring solid navigation and thorough preparation.

    "terrain_summary": "Terrain is rugged and varied: long stretches of rocky paths, sections of peat bog, and uneven ground underfoot; occasional exposed ridges and steep ascents/descents; footing can be slippery after rain. Conditions can change quickly, so good navigation and layered clothing are essential.",

UK weather can change rapidly; bring multiple layers, a waterproof shell, and extra insulation. Slippery rocks, peat bogs, and steep ascents can increase the risk of slips; wear sturdy boots with good grip and consider trekking poles. Tell someone your plan and expected return time; carry a whistle and a fully charged phone; in remote sections consider a personal locator beacon.",
