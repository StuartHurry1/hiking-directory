    "summary": "A 7.7 km coastal loop from Lansallos that links Hendersick and Talland Bay. The route combines grassy ridges, cliff-top paths with sea views, and inland stretches through fields and woodlands, returning to the village. Moderately challenging, it suits walkers who enjoy coastal scenery and ridge walking without long steep climbs.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed terrain including cliff-top paths, uneven dirt tracks, rocky steps, and field edges. Surfaces vary from compact paths to grassy uplands; expect mud in wet weather and exposed sections on the ridges. Regular ascents and descents with panoramic views over Talland Bay and the coastline.",
    "safety_notes": "Be mindful of cliff edges; winds can be strong along the coast. Check tide times if any part of the route is near the shore. Wear sturdy boots with good grip and bring weather-appropriate layers. Carry a map and compass or offline GPS, plus a charged phone. Bring water and snacks, and let someone know your plans. Dogs should be on a lead where required and kept away from unstable ground.",
