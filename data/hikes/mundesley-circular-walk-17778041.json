    "summary": "Mundesley Circular Walk is a challenging 23.4 km loop that begins and ends in Mundesley, UK. The route combines coastal paths, quiet lanes, and rural fields with several short ascents, making it a strenuous day out for experienced hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of coastal cliff and sea-washed paths, shingle or beach sections, grassy ridges, farm tracks, and some asphalt. Surfaces can be uneven and slippery when wet, with gates and stiles along the way. Strong winds and sun exposure are common on the coast.",
    "safety_notes": "This is a long, strenuous hike with elevation changes. Check tide times if any coastal sections require beach walking. Wear sturdy boots and weather-appropriate clothing for UK conditions. Bring map or GPS, water, snacks, and a basic first-aid kit. Inform someone of your plan and start early in winter due to shorter daylight. Be cautious on exposed coastal sections in high winds and avoid risky climbs near cliff edges.",
