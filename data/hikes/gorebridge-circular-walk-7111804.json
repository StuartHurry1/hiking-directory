    "safety_notes": "This is a hard, long route with exposed sections. Weather in the UK can change rapidly; check forecasts before setting out. Navigation is essential—bring a map and compass and know how to use them (GPS is helpful but not a substitute). Wear sturdy, ankle-supporting boots and waterproof clothing. Carry sufficient water and high-energy food for the duration, plus extra layers, a hat, gloves, and a whistle. Tell someone your planned route and expected return time; have a contingency plan in case of bad weather or emergency; be prepared for limited mobile signal on ridges.",
