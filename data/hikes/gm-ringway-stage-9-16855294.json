    "summary": "GM Ringway Stage 9 is a hard, long-distance stage of the GM Ringway in the United Kingdom. Covering 34.5 km, it features varied terrain, potential remote sections, and elevation changes that reward stamina and good navigation. Designed for experienced hikers, the stage requires careful pacing, daylight planning, and gear readiness, especially for changeable UK weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Expect a mix of farm tracks, grassy paths, woodland, and occasional boggy or wet ground. The route includes open moorland sections and gently to moderately steep climbs along uneven footing and rocky or compacted surfaces. Navigation is important due to possible waymark ambiguities, and weather can shift quickly, especially in exposed sections.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan your hike with a detailed route and share it with someone. Check the forecast and daylight hours before starting. Carry a map and compass (and know how to use them) or a reliable GPS. Wear sturdy boots and dress in layers with waterproof outerwear. Bring enough water and high-energy food for a long day, plus a charged phone and a backup power source. In remote stretches mobile reception may be poor; carry a whistle and know how to summon help. Be prepared for sudden weather changes; have an emergency bivvy or space blanket and know when to turn back. Leave gates as you find them; follow landowner access rules and practice Leave No Trace.",
