    "summary": "The Leicestershire Round is a demanding long-distance circuit in the UK, totaling 885.4 km and rated hard. The route threads through rural Leicestershire (region not specified on the page), offering a continuous mix of farmland, woodlands, hedgerows, villages and canal towpaths. It’s designed for experienced hikers who can plan multiple days, manage navigation, and handle variable UK weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly rural terrain with long farm tracks, field edges, hedgerows, and occasional paved lanes. Expect a mix of woodland stretches, canal towpaths, open fields and gentle hills. Terrain can be muddy after rain and can vary with seasons; occasional road sections require caution.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for multi-day sections with reliable navigation and daylight management. Carry current maps or GPS; know your planned resupply points. UK weather changes quickly—bring waterproofs and warm layers. Wear sturdy boots and pace yourself. Stay on public rights of way, mind livestock and road crossings near villages. Let someone know your itinerary; carry a whistle and a basic first-aid kit; in remote sections consider a means of emergency contact.",
