    "summary": "The Loch Ard Sculpture Trail is an 11.2 km moderate hike around the shores of Loch Ard in the UK, weaving through woodlands and along the water with a series of outdoor sculptures along the route. The trail combines gentle ascents with flat stretches, making it accessible to most fit walkers. Expect varied terrain, wildlife, and weather that can change quickly in Scotland.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain consists of well-maintained paths, gravel tracks, and some boardwalks. Expect mixed surfaces, occasional damp or muddy patches, tree roots, and a few gentle ascents. The route follows lochside and woodland sections with several viewpoints over Loch Ard.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for Scotland's variable weather; conditions can change quickly. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and dress in layers. Stay on marked paths; keep children nearby and be mindful of cyclists on shared sections. Bring a map or GPS, enough water, snacks, and a charged phone. The loch edge can be close in places—avoid getting too near the water and supervise children. Allow 3–4 hours for the full 11.2 km at a moderate pace, and start early in winter to maximize daylight.",
