    "summary": "A challenging 22.9 km circular hike from Hambleden Mill to Henley-on-Thames through the Central Chilterns, returning along riverside and rural paths. Rated hard, it combines river trails, hillside sections, and woodland footpaths with several climbs and uneven surfaces. The route offers varied scenery—meadows, chalk downs, and river views—and is best undertaken by experienced walkers with solid stamina.",
    "terrain_summary": "Terrain is varied: riverside and chalk paths, rural tracks, and occasional woodland sections. Expect uneven, sometimes muddy footing, grassy slopes, stiles, and some gentle ascents and descents in the Chilterns. Weather can affect footing, and sections near the river can be slippery after rain.",
    "safety_notes": "- Distance and elevation make this a hard day; plan for 5–7 hours. - Check UK weather and daylight; dress in layers and bring waterproofs. - Wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring a waterproof shell; gloves and a hat for cold conditions. - Navigation: carry a map or GPS and stay on public paths; be aware some areas may have limited signage. - River safety: stay back from edge in wet or windy conditions; footing can be unstable near the water. - Hydration and food: bring enough water and energy-rich snacks for the full distance. - Let someone know your plan and expected return; carry emergency contact information. - In winter or after heavy rain, sections can be very muddy or flooded; consider postponing if forecasts are poor. - For additional support, consider a shorter section or a guided option.",
