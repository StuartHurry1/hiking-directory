    "summary": "Crib Goch is a short ridge scramble in the UK, about 1.8 km in length. Despite the modest distance, the route is exposed with knife-edge sections and scrambling on rocky cresting, rewarding careful footing and good weather.",
    "terrain_summary": "Rugged rocky ridge with exposed crest, uneven surface, and several knife-edge sections. Some parts require hands-on scrambling; there are significant drop-offs on either side. Weather, wind, and visibility greatly affect difficulty, and rock can be loose in places.",
    "safety_notes": "Conditions can change rapidly; always check the forecast and avoid the route in strong winds, heavy rain, or ice. The route has exposed, knife-edge sections and requires good footing and attention to footing; wearing a helmet is recommended. Keep to the crest, maintain spacing within your group, and turn back if unsure. In poor visibility or winter conditions, the route becomes technical and should only be attempted with appropriate experience or a guide. Do not rely on GPS alone; carry map and compass, and inform someone of your plans.",
