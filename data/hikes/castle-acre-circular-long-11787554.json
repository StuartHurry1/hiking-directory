    "summary": "Castle Acre Circular (Long) is a 14.5 km loop in the UK that starts and finishes in the Castle Acre area. The route winds through rolling farmland, hedgerows, quiet lanes, and glimpses of historic castle ruins. With moderate difficulty, it suits hikers who enjoy varied scenery and a full day of walking, featuring gates, stiles, and occasional road sections.",
    "terrain_summary": "Predominantly mixed rural terrain: well-trodden paths, grassy verges, chalky or earthy tracks, and short stretches on quiet country roads. Expect muddy patches after rain, uneven ground near stiles and field edges, gentle ascents and descents, hedgerow-lined sections, and occasional exposure in open fields.",
    "safety_notes": "Check weather and daylight hours for your planned day. Wear sturdy boots and bring waterproofs and layers. Public rights of way may include stiles and gates; keep dogs under control and follow local access rules. Some sections pass near roads; stay alert to traffic. Carry a map or download offline navigation, a charged phone, water, snacks, and a small first-aid kit, plus an emergency whistle. Be mindful of livestock, farming activity, and ticks in long grass; leave gates as you find them.",
