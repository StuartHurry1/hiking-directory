    "summary": "Belmore Forest's Pollnagollum Cave Walk is a 7.6 km moderate hike in the United Kingdom that winds through woodland to reach Pollnagollum Cave. The route blends forest trails with a brief cave section, offering varied scenery and a touch of exploration for hikers with moderate fitness.

    "terrain_summary": "The trail combines well-defined forest paths, occasional boardwalks, and rocky, uneven sections. Expect gentle elevation changes, muddy patches after rain, and a cave segment with low ceilings and damp surfaces. Footing can be slippery near the cave entrance, so sturdy footwear is recommended, with the possibility of brief tight spaces if you enter the cave.",

Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and dress in layers. Stay on marked trails, avoid disturbing wildlife, and be mindful of slipping hazards from mud and wet rocks. Do not hike alone; inform someone of your plans and carry a charged phone. In wet weather, water levels may rise near the cave; if conditions look unsafe, turn back.",
