    "summary": "A demanding 27.2 km circular hike near East Wretham, weaving through Thetford Forest and surrounding heathland. The trail combines long forest tracks with open sections, requiring good fitness and navigation.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed terrain including gravel forest tracks, dirt paths, grassy stretches and open heath. Expect muddy patches after rain, exposed roots, and gradual elevation changes; some sections may require careful route-finding through woodland and heath.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan for a full-day hike (roughly 6–9 hours). Carry a detailed map and compass or a reliable GPS, and know how to use them. Check weather and daylight hours; in winter the route can be exposed and very muddy. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and dress in layers. Bring ample water and high-energy food, plus a small first aid kit and a whistle. Tell someone your planned route and expected return time. Be mindful of other forest users and potential cyclists; navigation aids are helpful in remote sections. If visibility is poor or conditions worsen, consider turning back or choosing a shorter route.",
