    "summary": "A challenging 70-kilometer trek along the Frome Valley in the UK intended for experienced hikers. The route combines riverside paths, farmland lanes, and varied terrain across multiple days, with scenic stretches and some strenuous sections requiring good navigation and fitness.",
    "terrain_summary": "The hike features a mixed-terrain profile: canal towpaths, riverside trails, woodland tracks, grassy fields, and occasional stiles and gentle to moderate climbs. Surfaces range from compact gravel and dirt to muddy, uneven ground; weather can significantly affect footing and some sections may be exposed.",

Carry navigation tools (map and compass) even if you have a GPS. Bring sufficient water and food, plus a way to purify water. Inform someone of your itinerary and expected return. Be prepared for limited phone signal in rural stretches and possible day-length changes in winter. Stay on official paths, watch for livestock, and have a plan for emergencies.",
