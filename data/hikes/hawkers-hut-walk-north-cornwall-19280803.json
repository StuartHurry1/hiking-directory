    "summary": "A gentle 4.8 km circuit near Hawker's Hut in North Cornwall, offering easy terrain and scenic countryside suitable for families, casual walkers, and beginners seeking a relaxed day out in the UK countryside.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route follows well-maintained farm tracks and public footpaths with a mix of grassy fields and compact earth. Expect some uneven sections and occasional muddy patches after rain. There are gentle gradients and occasional steps near the hut; surface can be uneven underfoot, so sturdy footwear is recommended. The scenery includes open fields, hedgerows, and glimpses of rural Cornwall.",
    "safety_notes": "This is an easy, relatively short walk, but conditions can change with weather. Wear sturdy waterproof footwear and a weather-appropriate layer. Check for muddy patches after rain and take care on uneven surfaces. Bring water, snacks, and a map or GPS; carry a charged mobile phone in case of emergency.
