    "summary": "Chalkland Way is a demanding long-distance hike across chalk downland in the UK, totaling 122.2 km and typically undertaken over multiple days. Hikers can expect rolling ridgelines, grassy trails, hedgerows, and a mix of farm tracks and quiet lanes. The route suits experienced trekkers comfortable with long days, variable weather, and navigating open countryside.",
    "terrain_summary": "The route traverses chalk downland and farmland: exposed ridgelines, chalk soil that can be slippery when wet, flinty sections, and a mix of paved lanes and minor roads. Paths are often grassy, uneven, and may be muddy after rain. There are occasional stiles and gates; navigation relies on markers and map reading. Be prepared for long open stretches with limited shelter.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan as a multi-day trek with lodging or camping. Carry a detailed map and compass and know how to use them; check local weather and daylight hours. Wear sturdy boots, bring extra layers, sun protection, and rain gear. Hydration and regular snacks are essential. Watch for livestock on farmland and follow gate and stile etiquette. Stay on marked paths, tell someone your itinerary, and have a plan for emergencies; mobile signal may be limited in remote sections. Include a basic first aid kit, blister care, a whistle, a space blanket or bivvy, and a headlamp with spare batteries.",
