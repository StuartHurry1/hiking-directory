It's aimed at experienced hikers who enjoy a demanding day on the trails; plan for a long outing and be prepared for weather and footing changes.",
    "terrain_summary": "Mixed surfaces: muddy tracks after rain, uneven grass paths, chalk footpaths, forested trails, hedgerows, and some road sections. Expect undulating terrain with a few steep sections, gates and stiles, and occasional exposure on open countryside.",
    "safety_notes": "Check the weather and daylight hours before you go. Wear sturdy, waterproof footwear and dress in layers. Bring a map and compass (or a reliable GPS) and ensure your phone is charged. Carry enough water and high-energy snacks; have a small first aid kit. Let someone know your planned route and finish time. Be cautious on gates, livestock crossings, and road edges; be aware that mobile coverage may be limited in rural areas. Start early in winter to maximize daylight.",
