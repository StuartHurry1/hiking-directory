    "summary": "A challenging 22.2 km circular hike in the UK that climbs rolling chalk downs and traverses exposed upland and countryside. The route combines long ascents, grassy tracks, hedged fields, and a few road crossings, making it a strenuous day out for fit hikers.",
    "terrain_summary": "Varied terrain including long grassy downs, chalk tracks, uneven earth, and occasional mud; stiles and gates; exposed ridges in parts; some minor road crossings.",
    "safety_notes": "Plan a long day with a weather-appropriate kit. Exposed sections can be windy and temperatures can change quickly on upland terrain. Wear sturdy waterproof boots and bring layered clothing, a waterproof jacket and trousers, and sufficient water and snacks. Carry a map and compass (GPS is helpful but don’t rely on it). Have a charged phone and an emergency layer; let someone know your route and expected finish time. Be mindful of livestock in fields and follow gates; expect muddy and slippery patches and allow extra time for a hard pace. In winter, daylight is limited—start early or shorten the route if needed.",
