Wear sturdy footwear with good grip and bring weather-appropriate clothing. Carry a map and compass (or GPS), a charged phone, and a basic first aid kit. Tell someone your plan and expected return. Stay on marked paths, beware of cliff edges, and be cautious of livestock and gates. Carry sufficient water and a small snack for energy.",
