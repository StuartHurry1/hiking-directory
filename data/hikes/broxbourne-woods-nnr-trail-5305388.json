    "safety_notes": "This is a long, hard hike. Plan to spend roughly half a day to a full day (roughly 6–9 hours depending on pace and conditions). Wear sturdy hiking boots and dress in layers; bring a weather-appropriate jacket. Stay on marked trails, carry a map and compass or GPS, and don't rely solely on a phone. Carry enough water and snacks, a small first aid kit, a whistle, and a light source. Check the forecast, be prepared for mud and slippery surfaces after rain, and take care around other path users and wildlife. Let someone know your plans and expected return time.",
